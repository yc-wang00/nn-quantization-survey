# Deep learning-based video coding: A review and a case study

## Summary

Summary: This paper reviews the application of deep learning for image and video coding. The works are divided into two categories, deep schemes and deep tools. Deep schemes have achieved higher or similar compression efficiency as traditional schemes for image coding and deep tools are capable of surpassing HEVC for video coding. A case study of a developed prototype video codec, DLVC, highlights the significant improvement in compression efficiency with two deep tools resulting to 39.6% and 33.0% bits saving compared to HEVC under random-access and low-delay configurations, respectively.

<Abstract:> This paper reviews the representative works about using deep learning for image/video coding, which has been an actively developing research area since the year of 2015. The related works are divided into two categories: new coding schemes that are built primarily upon deep networks (deep schemes), and deep network-based coding tools (deep tools) that shall be used within traditional coding schemes or together with traditional coding tools. Deep schemes have achieved comparable or even higher compression efficiency than the state-of-the-art traditional schemes for image coding, while deep tools have demonstrated the compression capability beyond HEVC for video coding. However, deep schemes have not yet reached the current height of HEVC for video coding, and deep tools remain largely unexplored at many aspects including the tradeoff between compression efficiency and encoding/decoding complexity, the optimization for perceptual naturalness or semantic quality, the speciality and universality, the federated design of multiple deep tools, and so on. The paper also presents a case study of a developed prototype video codec, namely Deep Learning Video Coding (DLVC), which features two deep tools that help improve the compression efficiency by a significant margin. DLVC is able to achieve on average 39.6% and 33.0% bits saving than HEVC, under random-access and low-delay configurations, respectively.
