# A survey of product quantization

## Summary

<Summary: >The paper reviews Product Quantization (PQ) search algorithm and its derivatives and provides sample codes. It also surveys recent quantization-based techniques including generalized representations of PQ encoding, practical large-scale systems with an inverted index structure, and hardware-based accelerations. PQ offers three attractive properties- compressing input vector, efficient computing of distance, and hybridization with other indexing structures. The paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey of recent PQ-based methods.


## Target Task

Target: General quantization techniques in computer vision or information retrieval

## Content

<Abstract: >In this paper, we review the fundamental algorithm of Product Quantization (PQ) search and its derivatives and provide executable sample codes. We also provide a comprehensive survey of recent quantization-based techniques including generalized representations of PQ encoding, practical large-scale systems with an inverted index structure, and hardware-based accelerations. PQ offers three attractive properties: compressing an input vector into a short code, efficiently computing the approximate distance between a raw vector and a compressed PQ code, and having simple data structure and coding algorithms that allow hybridization with other indexing structures. The goal of the paper is to provide a comprehensive survey of recent PQ-based methods.
