# Understanding and overcoming the challenges of efficient transformer quantization

## Summary

Summary: The paper explores quantization techniques for transformer-based models in order to reduce their high latency and memory requirements for deployment on resource-limited devices. The authors present three quantization solutions and introduce a novel per-embedding-group quantization scheme for transformers. These methods achieve state-of-the-art results for post-training quantization on the GLUE benchmark using BERT and show that ultra-low bit-width quantization for transformer weights and embeddings can lead to significant memory savings with minimal accuracy loss.

<Abstract: >Transformer-based models have become the standard for a broad range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but their high latency and memory footprint make deployment on resource-limited devices inefficient. In this paper, we explore quantization for transformers and present three solutions based on post-training quantization and quantization-aware training. We show that transformers face unique quantization challenges due to their high dynamic activation ranges and introduce a novel quantization scheme, per-embedding-group quantization. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art results for post-training quantization on the GLUE benchmark using BERT. Additionally, we show that ultra-low bit-width quantization for transformer weights and embeddings can result in significant memory savings with minimum accuracy loss.
