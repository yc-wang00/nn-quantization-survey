# Beyond attributes: High-order attribute features for zero-shot learning

## Summary

<Summary: > The authors propose a zero-shot learning framework, SeeNet-HAF, that utilizes high-order attribute features to obtain discriminative semantic vectors for each class. SeeNet-HAF consists of two streams for dynamic object region localization and complementary object region discovery. The authors also discuss various approaches for establishing the correlation between image and semantic spaces in zero-shot learning and compare different methods for learning a projection function. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SeeNet-HAF over existing approaches.

<Abstract: >In this paper, the authors propose SeeNet-HAF, a framework for zero-shot learning (ZSL) that integrates high-order attribute features (HAF) to obtain discriminative semantic vectors for each class. SeeNet-HAF consists of two streams, one for dynamic object region localization and the other for complementary object region discovery. The proposed framework also includes a fast hyperparameter search strategy. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of SeeNet-HAF over existing methods. The paper discusses various approaches for establishing the correlation between image and semantic spaces in ZSL and highlights representative methods based on matrix optimization and convolutional neural networks. The authors describe three groups of methods for learning a projection function from visual feature to semantic space, and compare various approaches within each group, such as SOC classifier, ALE, DeViSE, and SJE.  </Abstract:>
