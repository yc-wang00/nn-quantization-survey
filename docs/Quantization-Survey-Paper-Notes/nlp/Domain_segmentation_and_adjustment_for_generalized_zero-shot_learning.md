# Domain segmentation and adjustment for generalized zero-shot learning

## Summary

<Summary: >The paper proposes a method for generalized zero-shot recognition to address the imbalance between training data for seen and unseen classes. The approach uses a threshold and probabilistic distribution joint method to segment testing instances into seen, unseen, and uncertain domains. The uncertain domain is further adjusted to address domain shift. Experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of the approach.

<Abstract: >In this paper, the authors propose a method to realize the generalized zero-shot recognition in different domains to address the imbalance of training data between seen and unseen classes. They argue that synthesizing unseen data may not be an ideal approach for addressing the domain shift caused by the imbalance of the training data. The authors propose a threshold and probabilistic distribution joint method to segment the testing instances into seen, unseen and uncertain domains. Moreover, the uncertain domain is further adjusted to alleviate the domain shift. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show that the proposed method exhibits competitive performance compared with that based on generative models.
