# Multi-task retrieval for knowledge-intensive tasks

## Summary

<Summary: > The paper proposes a multi-task trained model for neural retrieval, aiming to solve the problem of performance degradation when applied to out-of-domain data. The method outperforms previous ones in the few-shot setting and rivals specialized neural retrievers even with abundant in-domain training data. The retriever improves existing models for downstream tasks and performs closely to the state of the art on multiple benchmarks.

<Abstract: >Retrieving relevant contexts from a large corpus is a crucial step for tasks such as open-domain question answering and fact checking. Although neural retrieval outperforms traditional methods like tf-idf and BM25, its performance degrades considerably when applied to out-of-domain data. Driven by the question of whether a neural retrieval model can be universal and perform robustly on a wide variety of problems, we propose a multi-task trained model. Our approach not only outperforms previous methods in the few-shot setting, but also rivals specialized neural retrievers, even when in-domain training data is abundant. With the help of our retriever, we improve existing models for downstream tasks and closely match or improve the state of the art on multiple benchmarks.
