# Targeted adversarial training for natural language understanding

## Summary

<Summary: >The paper introduces a Targeted Adversarial Training algorithm to enhance adversarial training for natural language understanding. This technique prioritizes adversarial training steps based on the model's current errors, resulting in improved accuracy and state-of-the-art zero-shot results on XNLI.

<Abstract: >We present a simple yet effective Targeted Adversarial Training (TAT) algorithm to improve adversarial training for natural language understanding. The key idea is to introspect current mistakes and prioritize adversarial training steps to where the model errs the most. Experiments show that TAT can significantly improve accuracy over standard adversarial training on GLUE and attain new state-of-the-art zero-shot results on XNLI.
