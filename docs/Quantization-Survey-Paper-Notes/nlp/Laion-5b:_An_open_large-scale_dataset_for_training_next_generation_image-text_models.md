# Laion-5b: An open large-scale dataset for training next generation image-text models

## Summary

Summary: The paper presents LAION-5B, a dataset consisting of 5.85 billion CLIP-filtered image-text pairs, of which 2.32 billion pairs contain English language, which was created to study the training and capabilities of large-scale language-vision models. The dataset enables successful replication and fine-tuning of foundational models and facilitates further experiments. The paper also includes several nearest neighbor indices, an improved web-interface, and detection scores for watermark, NSFW, and toxic content detection.

<Abstract: > Groundbreaking language-vision architectures like CLIP and DALL-E proved the utility of
training on large amounts of noisy image-text data, without relying on expensive accurate labels
used in standard vision unimodal supervised learning. The resulting models showed capabilities
of strong text-guided image generation and transfer to downstream tasks, while performing
remarkably at zero-shot classiﬁcation with noteworthy out-of-distribution robustness. Since then,
large-scale language-vision models like ALIGN, BASIC, GLIDE, Flamingo and Imagen made
further improvements. Studying the training and capabilities of such models requires datasets
containing billions of image-text pairs. Until now, no datasets of this size have been made openly
available for the broader research community. To address this problem and democratize research
on large-scale multi-modal models, we present LAION-5B - a dataset consisting of 5.85 billion
CLIP-ﬁltered image-text pairs, of which 2.32B contain English language. We show successful
replication and ﬁne-tuning of foundational models like CLIP, GLIDE and Stable Diﬀusion using
the dataset, and discuss further experiments enabled with an openly available dataset of this
scale. Additionally we provide several nearest neighbor indices, an improved web-interface for
dataset exploration and subset generation, and detection scores for watermark, NSFW, and toxic
content detection.
