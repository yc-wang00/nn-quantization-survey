# Re-imagen: Retrieval-augmented text-to-image generator

## Summary

<Summary: >The paper presents the Retrieval-Augmented Text-to-Image Generator (Re-Imagen), which employs retrieved information to generate high-quality and accurate images of uncommon entities, overcoming the limitations faced by state-of-the-art text-to-image models.

<Abstract: >Research on text-to-image generation has witnessed significant progress in generating diverse and photo-realistic images, driven by diffusion and auto-regressive models trained on large-scale image-text data. Though state-of-the-art models can generate high-quality images of common entities, they often have difficulty generating images of uncommon entities, such as ‘Chortai (dog)’ or ‘Picarones (food)’. To tackle this issue, we present the Retrieval-Augmented Text-to-Image Generator (Re-Imagen), a generative model that uses retrieved information to produce high-fidelity and faithful images, even for rare or unseen entities.
