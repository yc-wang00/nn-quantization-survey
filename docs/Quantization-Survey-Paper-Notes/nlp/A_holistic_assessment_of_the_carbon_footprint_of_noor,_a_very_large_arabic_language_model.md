# A holistic assessment of the carbon footprint of noor, a very large arabic language model

## Summary

Summary: The paper proposes a holistic assessment of the footprint of an extreme-scale language model. They assess the total carbon bill of the entire project which includes data collection, storage costs, research and development budgets, pretraining costs, and future serving estimates. The paper discusses pathways to reduce the carbon footprint of extreme-scale models.

<Abstract: >As ever larger language models grow more ubiquitous, it is crucial to consider their environmental impact. Characterised by extreme size and resource use, recent generations of models have been criticised for their voracious appetite for compute, and thus significant carbon footprint. In this work, we propose a holistic assessment of the footprint of an extreme-scale language model, Noor. We assess the total carbon bill of the entire project, starting with data collection and storage costs, including research and development budgets, pretraining costs, future serving estimates, and other exogenous costs necessary for this international cooperation. Notably, we find that inference costs and exogenous factors can have a significant impact on the total budget. Finally, we discuss pathways to reduce the carbon footprint of extreme-scale models.
