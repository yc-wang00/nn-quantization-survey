# Analysis of joint multilingual sentence representations and semantic k-nearest neighbor graphs

## Summary

Summary: The authors propose a joint multilingual sentence encoder and a k-nn graph over a large space of news sentences in seven languages, achieving excellent multilingual retrieval quality on the UN corpus of 11.3M sentences. Their multilingual encoder outperforms previous work on large-scale similarity search and they define new quantitative evaluation tasks to analyze the generalization behavior of multilingual sentence embeddings with respect to unseen domains and languages. Their system can also handle zero-shot transfers to several linguistically related languages without using any resources of those languages. The code used in this paper is freely available in the LASER toolkit.

<Abstract: > Multilingual sentence and document representations have been gaining importance lately due to the desire to transfer NLP applications across different languages. In this paper, the authors investigate a joint multilingual sentence encoder and a k-nn graph over the space of 566 million news sentences in seven different languages. They provide a detailed analysis of both the multilingual sentence encoder and the learned graph, which show excellent multilingual retrieval quality on the UN corpus of 11.3M sentences. The authors show that their multilingual encoder outperforms previous work on large-scale similarity search and define new quantitative evaluation tasks to analyze the generalization behavior of multilingual sentence embeddings with respect to unseen domains and languages. They also demonstrate that their system can handle zero-shot transfers to several linguistically related languages without using any resources of those languages. The code used in this paper is freely available in the LASER toolkit.
