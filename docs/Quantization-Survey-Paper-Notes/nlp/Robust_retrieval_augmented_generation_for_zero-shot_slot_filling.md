# Robust retrieval augmented generation for zero-shot slot filling

## Summary

Summary: The paper presents a novel approach to zero-shot slot filling that uses dense passage retrieval and robust training procedures for retrieval augmented generation models. The system demonstrates promising results on both T-REx and zsRE slot filling datasets and exhibits domain adaptation capability on a new variant of the TACRED dataset.

<Abstract: >Automatically inducing high quality knowledge graphs from a given collection of documents still remains a challenging problem in AI. One way to make headway for this problem is through advancements in a related task known as slot filling. In this paper, we present a novel approach to zero-shot slot filling that extends dense passage retrieval with hard negatives and robust training procedures for retrieval augmented generation models. Our model reports large improvements on both T-REx and zsRE slot filling datasets, improving both passage retrieval and slot value generation, and ranking at the top-1 position in the KILT leaderboard. Moreover, we demonstrate the robustness of our system showing its domain adaptation capability on a new variant of the TACRED dataset for slot filling, through a combination of zero/few-shot learning.
