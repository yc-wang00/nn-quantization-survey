# Transzero: Attribute-guided transformer for zero-shot learning

## Summary

<Summary: > The paper introduces TransZero, a Transformer network for zero-shot learning that helps recognize novel classes by transferring knowledge from seen to unseen classes. It uses a feature augmentation encoder to improve the transferability of visual features and a visual-semantic decoder to localize the image regions most relevant to each attribute. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in three ZSL benchmarks.

<Abstract:> The paper proposes TransZero, an attribute-guided Transformer network for zero-shot learning (ZSL), which aims to recognize novel classes by transferring semantic knowledge from seen to unseen classes. TransZero takes a feature augmentation encoder to alleviate cross-dataset bias and improves the transferability of visual features by reducing the entangled relative geometry relationships among region features. It employs a visual-semantic decoder to localize the image regions most relevant to each attribute, and conducts effective visual-semantic interaction in a visual-semantic embedding network. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three ZSL benchmarks.
