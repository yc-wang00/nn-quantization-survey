# Precision scaling of neural networks for efficient audio processing

## Summary

<Summary: >The paper presents a study on the impact of scaling the precision of neural networks for efficient audio processing like voice-activity detection and single-channel speech enhancement. Lower bit precision in neural networks results in a significant reduction in processing time (up to 30x) with a negligible (< 3.14%) impact on performance only in the case of classification tasks. The authors have also presented a table with computation/memory demand and performance of DNNs with baseline/reduced bit width.

<Abstract: >In this paper, the authors present a study on the impact of scaling the precision of neural networks for efficient audio processing, specifically on voice-activity detection and single-channel speech enhancement. Through experiments conducted with real user data, they demonstrate that deep neural networks that use lower bit precision can significantly reduce the processing time (up to 30x), while their performance impact is low (< 3.14%) only in the case of classification tasks such as those present in voice activity detection. The authors also provide computation/memory demand and performance of DNNs with baseline/reduced bit width in a table.
