# Resource-efficient dnns for keyword spotting using neural architecture search and quantization

## Summary

<Summary: >This paper proposes using neural architecture search to optimize CNNs for keyword spotting in low-resource environments. A highly efficient model was obtained with 95.4% accuracy using only 494.8 kB of memory and 19.6 million operations. Weight quantization was used to reduce memory consumption. Experimental results and comparisons with related work are presented.

<Abstract:>This paper presents a neural architecture search approach to optimize convolutional neural networks for keyword spotting in low-resource environments. The approach was able to obtain a highly efficient model with 95.4% accuracy on the Google speech commands dataset using only 494.8 kB of memory and 19.6 million operations. The model was further optimized using weight quantization, which reduced memory consumption. The paper also shows that increasing the number of input features substantially improves performance. The paper provides experimental results and comparisons with related work. Code related to the paper is available online.
