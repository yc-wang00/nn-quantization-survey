# Linear receivers for massive MIMO systems with one-bit ADCs

## Summary

Summary: The authors propose three linear receivers for massive MIMO systems with 1-bit ADCs which are Bussgang-based Maximal Ratio Combining (BMRC), Bussgang-based Zero-Forcing (BZF), and Bussgang-based Minimum Mean Squared Error (BMMSE). These receivers are obtained by using the Bussgang decomposition to handle the non-linear effect of one-bit ADCs. Simulation results indicate that the newly proposed receivers have lower bit error rate floors compared to conventional linear receivers.

In this letter, the authors propose three linear receivers for massive MIMO systems with 1-bit ADCs: Bussgang-based Maximal Ratio Combining (BMRC), Bussgang-based Zero-Forcing (BZF), and Bussgang-based Minimum Mean Squared Error (BMMSE). The proposed receivers are obtained by using the Bussgang decomposition to cope with the non-linear effect of the one-bit ADCs. Simulation results show significantly lower bit error rate floors obtained by the proposed receivers than those of conventional linear receivers.
