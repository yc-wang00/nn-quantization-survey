# DGC-vector: A new speaker embedding for zero-shot voice conversion

## Summary

<Summary: >The paper proposes a new method, DGC-vector for speaker representation in zero-shot voice conversion algorithms. The method combines the benefits of D-vector, GST-based speaker representation, and auxiliary supervision to improve speaker similarity in zero-shot VC. The authors demonstrate through objective and subjective evaluations that the proposed method achieves decent performance and outperforms other baseline speaker representations. The paper also covers related works on speaker embeddings, including D-vector.

<Abstract: > In this research paper, the authors propose a novel method called DGC-vector for speaker representation in zero-shot voice conversion algorithms. The paper studies the impact of speaker embeddings on zero-shot voice conversion performance and aims to improve the speaker similarity of zero-shot VC. The proposed method combines the advantages of D-vector, GST-based speaker representation, and auxiliary supervision. The authors show through objective and subjective evaluations that the proposed method achieves a decent performance on zero-shot VC and improves the speaker similarity significantly over other baseline speaker representations. The paper also briefly discusses related works in the field of speaker embeddings, including D-vector.
