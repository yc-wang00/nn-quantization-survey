# Noisevc: Towards high quality zero-shot voice conversion

## Summary

<Summary: > The paper proposes NoiseVC, an approach for zero-shot voice conversion using Vector Quantization (VQ) and Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) with Noise Augmentation to enhance disentanglement capability. The approach doesn't rely on parallel data, pre-trained models or text transcripts, making it suitable for low-resourced languages. The authors conduct several experiments and demonstrate that NoiseVC has strong disentanglement ability with a small quality sacrifice.

## Content

<Abstract:> In this paper, the authors propose NoiseVC, an approach for zero-shot voice conversion that can disentangle contents based on Vector Quantization (VQ) and Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC). They perform Noise Augmentation to further enhance the disentanglement capability. The authors conduct several experiments and demonstrate that NoiseVC has a strong disentanglement ability with a small sacrifice of quality. They compare their approach with previous methods and show that it does not rely on parallel data, pre-trained models or text transcripts, making it particularly suitable for low-resourced languages.
