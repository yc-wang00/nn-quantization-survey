# Hardware aware training for efficient keyword spotting on general purpose and specialized hardware

## Summary

<Summary: >This paper presents a study that utilizes Hardware Aware Training (HAT) to create new Keyword Spotting (KWS) neural networks based on the Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) that achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and have low parameter counts while operating efficiently on standard hardware. The study also identifies the power requirements of custom-designed accelerator hardware that outperforms general-purpose low power hardware and one designed for a specific goal.

<Abstract: >Keyword spotting (KWS) is a crucial interface for various mobile and edge applications like phones, wearables,and cars. As KWS systems are "always on," maximizing the accuracy and power efficiency of these systems is crucial for their success. This study uses Hardware Aware Training (HAT) to build new KWS neural networks based on the Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) that attain state-of-the-art (SotA) accuracy and have low parameter counts. Furthermore, this neural network can operate efficiently on standard hardware (212 µW). This study also identifies the power requirements of custom-designed accelerator hardware that achieves SotA power efficiency of 8.79 µW, outclassing general-purpose low power hardware (a microcontroller) by 24× and one designed for a specific goal (ASICs) by 16×.  </Abstract:>
