# Joint antenna selection and hybrid beamformer design using unquantized and quantized deep learning networks

## Summary

<Summary: > The paper proposes a deep learning-based approach for joint antenna selection and hybrid beamformer design in millimeter wave communications. This approach uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained with several noisy channel matrices to achieve robust performance. The proposed CNN framework provides an order better spectral efficiency and is 10 times faster than conventional techniques. Additionally, the proposed network, saved in no more than 5 bits, is suitable for digital mobile devices.

<Abstract:> In this paper, the authors propose a deep learning-based approach to joint antenna selection and hybrid beamformer design for massive MIMO systems in millimeter wave communications. They formulate the problem as a classification/prediction task for convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The CNNs are trained with several noisy channel matrices to achieve robust performance. Numerical experiments reveal that the proposed CNN framework provides an order better spectral efficiency and is 10 times faster than conventional techniques. The authors also demonstrate that the proposed network, saved in no more than 5 bits, is suited for digital mobile devices.
