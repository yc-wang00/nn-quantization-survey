# Deep neural network-based quantized signal reconstruction for DOA estimation

## Summary

<Summary: > The paper proposes a DNN-based recovery technique with low-cost ADC in an IRS for DOA estimation in a massive MIMO system. The proposed DNN estimates the quantization noise caused by the ADC and provides better reconstruction performance than existing methods. The network's reconstruction performance is compared with state-of-the-art methods, showing an improvement in DOA estimation using 1-bit ADC over 2-bit ADC.

<Abstract: >For a massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system using intelligent reï¬‚ecting surface (IRS) equipped with radio frequency (RF) chains, the multi-channel RF chains can be expensive, particularly when high-resolution and high-speed analog to digital converters (ADC) are used in each RF channel. In this paper, a direction of angle (DOA) estimation problem is investigated with low-cost ADC in IRS, and a deep neural network (DNN) is proposed as a recovery method for the low-resolution sampled signal. The proposed DNN estimates the quantization noise caused by the ADC and yields better reconstruction performance than state-of-the-art methods. Simulation results show that the performance of the DOA estimation using 1-bit ADC is improved to exceed that using 2-bit ADC. The paper presents a signal and quantization noise model and proposes a scheme for signal reconstruction. The reconstruction performance of the proposed network is also compared with state-of-the-art methods. </Abstract>
