## Content

<Abstract: >Quantized channel state information (CSI) plays a critical role in precoding design which helps reap the merits of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology. In order to reduce the overhead of CSI feedback, we propose a deep learning based CSI quantization method by developing a joint convolutional residual network (JC-ResNet) which benefits MIMO channel feature extraction and recovery from the perspective of bit-level quantization performance. Experiments show that our proposed method substantially improves the performance.
