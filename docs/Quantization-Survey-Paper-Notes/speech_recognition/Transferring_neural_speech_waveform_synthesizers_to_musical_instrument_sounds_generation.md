# Transferring neural speech waveform synthesizers to musical instrument sounds generation

## Summary

Summary: The study explores the use of three neural speech synthesizers in generating musical instrument sounds trained under three scenarios and compared their performance. Pre-training speech synthesizers on speech data, and fine-tuning on music data significantly improves their performance. The results of the perceptual test prove that WaveGlow is best for zero-shot learning, while NSF is most suitable for other scenarios and generates samples similar to natural audio.

<Abstract: > Recent neural waveform synthesizers like WaveNet, WaveGlow and the neural-source-filter model have shown impressive performance in speech synthesis. This study aims to explore a similar approach in music production. Three neural speech synthesizers are compared for generating musical instruments sounds, and they are trained under three different scenarios: (1) training on only music data, (2) zero-shot learning from the speech domain and (3) fine-tuning-based adaptation from the speech to the music domain. The results of a perceptual test prove that pre-training the speech synthesizers on speech data, and fine-tuning them on music data significantly improves their performance. The study concludes that WaveGlow performs best in zero-shot learning, while NSF is most suitable for the other scenarios and generates samples close to natural audio.
