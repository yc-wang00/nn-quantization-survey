# Vqmivc: Vector quantization and mutual information-based unsupervised speech representation disentanglement for one-shot voice conversion

## Summary

<Summary: >The paper introduces a one-shot voice conversion approach that uses vector quantization and mutual information-based VC (VQMIVC) to reduce inter-dependencies of speech representations. VQCPC and MI are applied during training to achieve SRD. Experimental results show that VQMIVC outperforms current state-of-the-art one-shot VC systems by retaining source content and intonation variations, while capturing target speaker characteristics, leading to higher speech naturalness and speaker similarity.


## Target Task

speech recognition

## Content

<Abstract: >One-shot voice conversion (VC) can disentangle speech representations to perform conversion across arbitrary speakers with only a single target-speaker utterance for reference. The vector quantization and mutual information-based VC (VQMIVC) approach reduces the inter-dependencies of content, speaker and pitch representations in an unsupervised manner. VQCPC and MI are used during training to achieve SRD. Results show that VQMIVC retains source linguistic content and intonation variations, while capturing target speaker characteristics, achieving higher speech naturalness and speaker similarity than current state-of-the-art one-shot VC systems.
