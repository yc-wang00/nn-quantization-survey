# A study on speech enhancement using exponent-only floating point quantized neural network (eofp-qnn)

## Summary

Summary: The study proposes a novel exponent-only floating-point quantized neural network (EOFP-QNN) consisting of two stages (mantissa-quantization and exponent-quantization) and evaluates its performance on two types of neural networks (BLSTM and FCN) for speech enhancement task. The study concludes that the proposed EOFP quantization technique significantly reduces model sizes while maintaining satisfactory speech-enhancement performance.

<Abstract: >The present study investigates the performance of speech enhancement using a novel exponent-only floating-point quantized neural network (EOFP-QNN). The proposed EOFP-QNN consists of two stages: mantissa-quantization and exponent-quantization. We evaluated the proposed EOFP quantization technique on two types of neural networks, namely, bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) and fully convolutional neural network (FCN), on a speech enhancement task. Experimental results showed that the model sizes can be significantly reduced while maintaining satisfactory speech-enhancement performance.
