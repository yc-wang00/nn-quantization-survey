# Dithered Quantization for Frequency-Domain Speech and Audio Coding.

## Summary

Summary: The paper discusses the use of dithered quantization in improving the perceived sound quality in speech and audio codecs that use discrete cosine transform (DCT) or modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) techniques. The paper also explores how dithering can be applied in the frequency domain to further enhance the quality of MDCT-based codecs, especially in achieving high quality at low bit rates.

<Abstract: Dithered quantization is a technique, which can be used to reduce or even eliminate the prominent problem in fixed-point digital signal processing of quantization noise. Speech and audio codecs using the discrete cosine transform (DCT) or modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) can use this technique to improve their perceived sound quality by using more uniform quantization steps. MDCT-based codecs have shown good compression while achieving high quality at low bit rates. Here, we show how dithering can be applied in the frequency domain to further improve the quality of MDCT-based codecs.>
