# [PDF][PDF] Wavelet transform speech recognition using vector quantization, dynamic time warping and artificial neural networks

## Summary

<Summary: > This paper explores the use of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) along with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), Vector Quantization (VQ) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for recognizing isolated words for a speaker-dependent system. It concludes that DWT can be an effective feature extraction tool for speech recognition as it can distribute specific features of the signal into different frequency bands without assuming any model for input speech signal. VQ and DTW with wavelets performed well, but the results for ANN were less promising because it is sensitive to time alignment and frame synchronization.

<Abstract: >In this paper we investigate the performance of the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) with Dynamic Time Warping, Vector Quantization and Artificial Neural Networks for speaker-dependent, isolated word recognition. Our experiments and simulation results indicate that the DWT is a potential contender to be a feature extraction tool for speech recognition. While vector quantization and dynamic time-warping with wavelets have yielded results comparable to those obtained with LPC, preliminary results suggest that the neural networks are sensitive to time alignment and frame synchronism. The Wavelet Transform is an elegant tool for the analysis of non-stationary signals like speech, distributing specific features of the signal into different frequency bands. It does not assume any model for the input speech signal and may be implemented as a fast, pyramidal algorithm.
