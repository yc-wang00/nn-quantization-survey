# Quantization of acoustic model parameters in automatic speech recognition framework

## Summary

<Summary: >This paper studies the impact of parameter quantization on the word recognition accuracy in hybrid automatic speech recognition systems that use deep neural network based models trained with the LF-MMI criterion and n-gram language models. The study was conducted on the standard Librispeech setup and the results provide an overview of recognition accuracy with respect to the applied quantization scheme.

<Abstract: >State-of-the-art hybrid automatic speech recognition (ASR) system exploits deep neural network (DNN) based acoustic models (AM) trained with Lattice Free-Maximum Mutual Information (LF-MMI) criterion and n-gram language models. The impact of parameter quantization on the overall word recognition performance is studied in this paper. Results obtained on standard Librispeech setup provide an interesting overview of recognition accuracy w.r.t. applied quantization scheme.
