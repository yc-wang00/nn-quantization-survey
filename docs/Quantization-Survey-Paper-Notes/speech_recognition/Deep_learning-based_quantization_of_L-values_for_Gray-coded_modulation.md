# Deep learning-based quantization of L-values for Gray-coded modulation

## Summary

<Summary: > The paper introduces a deep learning-based quantization scheme for log-likelihood ratio (L-value) storage, which is shown to be competitive with state-of-the-art schemes, reducing memory footprint by up to two and achieving a loss of performance smaller than 0.1dB with less than two effective bits per L-value. The authors analyze the dependency between average magnitudes of L-values and show that they follow a consistent ordering, independent of channel coefficient or interference distribution.

<Abstract: > In this work, a deep learning-based quantization scheme for log-likelihood ratio (L-value) storage in general fading scenarios affected by interference is introduced. We analyze the dependency between the average magnitudes of different L-values and show they follow a consistent ordering, regardless of the channel coefficient or interference distribution. Our method is shown to be competitive with state-of-the-art maximum mutual information quantization schemes, reducing the required memory footprint by a ratio of up to two and achieving a loss of performance smaller than 0.1dB with less than two effective bits per L-value or smaller than 0.04dB with 2.25 effective bits.
