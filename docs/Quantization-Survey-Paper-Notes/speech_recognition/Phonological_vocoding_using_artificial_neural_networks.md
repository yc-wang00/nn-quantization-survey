# Phonological vocoding using artificial neural networks

## Summary

Summary: The paper proposes a new approach for the task of phonological vocoding based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). They investigate the use of ANNs for the compression of speech in the context of low bit-rate speech coding. The approach is evaluated on the TIMIT speech corpus using two different vocoding schemes. The results show that the proposed ANNs-based vocoding approach outperforms the state-of-the-art MELP vocoder in terms of spectral distortion, cepstral distortion, and perceptual quality. Additionally, the proposed approach can facilitate better speaker recognition performance compared to MELP.

Abstract: In this paper, we present an approach for the task of phonological vocoding based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). Specifically, we investigate the use of ANNs for the compression of speech in the context of low bit-rate speech coding. The approach is evaluated on the TIMIT speech corpus using two different vocoding schemes. We present a quantitative analysis of the results in terms of spectral distortion, cepstral distortion, and perceptual quality. The results show that the proposed ANNs-based vocoding approach can achieve a significant improvement in terms of spectral distortion and perceptual quality compared to the state-of-the-art MELP vocoder. Additionally, the proposed approach can facilitate better speaker recognition performance compared to MELP.
