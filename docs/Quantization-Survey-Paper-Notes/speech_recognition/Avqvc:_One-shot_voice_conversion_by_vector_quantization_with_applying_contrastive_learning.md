# Avqvc: One-shot voice conversion by vector quantization with applying contrastive learning

## Summary

<Summary: >This paper proposes a novel framework called AVQVC that combines contrastive learning techniques and vector quantization voice conversion to improve the sound quality and performance of voice conversion models, without increasing complexity.


## Target Task

speech recognition

## Content

<Abstract: >Voice Conversion (VC) is a widely researched subject that aims to convert speech from a source speaker to speech of a target speaker while keeping the discourse content the same. In this paper, a novel framework called A VQVC is proposed, which stands for AutoVC and vector quantization voice conversion. The A VQVC framework applies contrastive learning techniques to effectively separate the content and timbre information from speech, which yields improved sound quality of the generated speech. The approach outperforms the traditional VQVC model without increasing the model's complexity.
