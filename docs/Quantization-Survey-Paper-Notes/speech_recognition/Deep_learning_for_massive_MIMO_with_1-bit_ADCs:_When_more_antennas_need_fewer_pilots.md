# Deep learning for massive MIMO with 1-bit ADCs: When more antennas need fewer pilots

## Summary

<Summary: >This paper proposes a deep-learning based channel estimation framework for uplink massive MIMO systems with 1-bit ADCs, which utilizes prior channel estimation observations and deep neural networks to learn the mapping from quantized received measurements to channels. Increasing the number of base station antennas leads to improved channel estimation performance and requires fewer pilots. Previous works did not address deep learning-based channel estimation for massive MIMO systems with 1-bit ADCs or the observation that more antennas need fewer pilots.

<Abstract: >This paper proposes a deep-learning based channel estimation framework for uplink massive MIMO systems with 1-bit ADCs. The framework leverages prior channel estimation observations and deep neural networks to learn the mapping from quantized received measurements to channels. The paper analytically proves that increasing the number of base station antennas leads to better channel estimation performance for the same pilot sequence length, and hence fewer pilots are required. Simulation results confirm these observations and show that more antennas lead to better channel estimation in terms of normalized mean squared error and signal-to-noise ratio per antenna. Prior work has not addressed deep learning-based channel estimation for massive MIMO systems with 1-bit ADCs or the counterintuitive observation that more antennas need fewer pilots.
