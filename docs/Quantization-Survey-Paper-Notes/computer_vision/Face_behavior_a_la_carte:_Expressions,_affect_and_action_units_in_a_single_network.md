# Face behavior a la carte: Expressions, affect and action units in a single network

## Summary

<Summary: >The paper focuses on the study of automatic facial behavior analysis using deep neural networks. The authors present a single holistic framework called FaceBehaviorNet for simultaneously learning three iconic tasks in facial behavior analysis. These tasks include automatic recognition of basic expressions, estimation of continuous affect and detection of facial action units. The authors claim to have conducted the first and largest study of all facial behavior tasks learned jointly using a single task model.

<Abstract: >Automatic facial behavior analysis has a long history of studies in the intersection of computer vision, physiology and psychology. However it is only recently, with the collection of large-scale datasets and powerful machine learning methods such as deep neural networks, that automatic facial behavior analysis started to thrive. Three of its iconic tasks are automatic recognition of basic expressions (e.g. happiness, sadness, surprise), estimation of continuous affect (e.g., valence and arousal), and detection of facial action units (activations of e.g. upper/inner eyebrows, nose wrinkles). Up until now these tasks have been studied independently by collecting a dedicated dataset and training a single-task model. We present the first and the largest study of all facial behaviour tasks learned jointly in a single holistic framework, which we call FaceBehaviorNet.
