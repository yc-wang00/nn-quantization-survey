# [PDF][PDF] Deep Learning Vector Quantization.

## Summary

<Summary: > The paper proposes combining neural networks with Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ), called Deep LVQ (DLVQ), to reduce fooling examples caused by the extrapolating nature of the log-softmax. The proposed method achieves comparable performance on MNIST and is more robust against fooling and adversarial examples.

<Abstract: >While deep neural nets (DNN’s) achieve impressive performance on image recognition tasks, previous studies have reported that DNN’s give high confidence predictions for unrecognizable images. Motivated by the observation that such fooling examples might be caused by the extrapolating nature of the log-softmax, we propose to combine neural networks with Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ). Our proposed method, called Deep LVQ (DLVQ), achieves comparable performance onMNIST while being more robust against fooling and adversarial examples.
