# Optimal precoding for multiuser MIMO systems with phase quantization and PSK modulation via branch-and-bound

## Summary

Summary: 
The paper proposes an optimal precoding algorithm for MIMO systems through phase quantization and PSK modulation to maximize the minimum distance of the decision threshold at receivers using a branch-and-bound strategy, which results in low bit error rates. It is generalizable for phase quantizers with an arbitrary number of phases using PSK modulation, and it outperforms existing methods. The proposed approach demonstrates significantly lower complexity than exhaustive search.

<Abstract:>
In this study, the authors propose an optimal precoding algorithm for MIMO systems with phase quantization and PSK modulation, where the algorithm maximizes the minimum distance to the decision threshold at the receivers using a branch-and-bound strategy. The proposed algorithm is constrained to constant envelope signals and phase quantization, and is superior to existing methods in terms of bit error rate. The authors generalize their work for phase quantizers with an arbitrary number of phases at the transmit antennas and PSK modulation, which is non-trivial due to the complexity of PSK symbols. The proposed precoder is optimal in terms of the Max-Min DDT criterion, obtained by using a sophisticated branch-and-bound strategy. The authors present numerical results showing that their proposed approach has significantly lower complexity than exhaustive search.
