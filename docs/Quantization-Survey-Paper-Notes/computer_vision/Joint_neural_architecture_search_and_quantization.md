# Joint neural architecture search and quantization

## Summary

Summary: This research paper presents a joint neural architecture search and quantization framework called JASQ, which uses a multi-objective evolutionary search algorithm to find compact neural network models suitable for mobile devices by balancing between model size and performance accuracy. The proposed method outperforms the methods that search only for architectures or only for quantization policies. Two models, JASQNet and JASQNet-Small, are obtained with joint search of architectures and quantization policies with 2.97% error rate and 0.9 MB on CIFAR-10.

In this research paper, the authors propose a joint neural architecture search and quantization framework, named JASQ, to enable the search for compact neural network models suitable for mobile devices. The method uses a multi-objective evolutionary search algorithm to find models that balance between model size and performance accuracy. The proposed approach outperforms the methods that search only for architectures or only for quantization policies. The experiments conducted show that under the balance between model size and performance accuracy, two models are obtained with joint search of architectures and quantization policies: a high-accuracy model and a small model, JASQNet and JASQNet-Small, that achieves 2.97% error rate with 0.9 MB on CIFAR-10.
