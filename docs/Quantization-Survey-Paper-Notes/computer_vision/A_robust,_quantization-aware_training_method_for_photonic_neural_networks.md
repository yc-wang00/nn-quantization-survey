<Abstract: The paper proposes a new training method for photonic neural networks (PNNs) to compensate for quantization noise, which is introduced due to analog-to-digital (ADC) and digital-to-analog (DAC) conversions. The proposed method takes into account the quantization during training, which leads to significant performance improvements during the inference phase. The experiments conducted on both image classification and time-series analysis tasks using a wide range of existing photonic neuromorphic architectures show the effectiveness of the proposed method in low-bit resolution photonic architectures and its generalization ability.>
