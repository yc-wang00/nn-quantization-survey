# QVIP: an ILP-based formal verification approach for quantized neural networks

## Summary

<Summary: This research paper proposes a formal verification approach for quantized neural networks (QNNs) which uses integer linear constraints that can be solved using off-the-shelf solvers. The approach is proven to be effective and efficient for local robustness verification and maximum robustness radius computation in QNNs with different quantization bits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.>

<Abstract:>
In this research paper, a formal verification approach for quantized neural networks (QNNs) is proposed. The verification problem of QNNs is encoded into the solving of integer linear constraints, which can be solved using off-the-shelf solvers. Local robustness verification and maximum robustness radius computation are demonstrated as applications of this approach. The effectiveness and efficiency of this approach are confirmed through experimental results on QNNs with different quantization bits, where it was shown to be two orders of magnitude faster and able to solve more verification tasks in the same time limit than the state-of-the-art methods.
