# Real-time quantized image super-resolution on mobile npus, mobile ai 2021 challenge: Report

## Summary

Summary: The paper presents the results of the first Mobile AI challenge where participants trained quantized models for 3X image upscaling. The proposed solutions achieved real-time performance on mobile or edge NPUs and can reconstruct Full HD images under 40-60 ms while providing high fidelity results. The paper provides a detailed description of all the models developed in the challenge.

<Abstract:>
Image super-resolution is an important computer vision problem with applications for mobile devices. To optimize this task for mobile and edge NPUs, the authors introduced the first Mobile AI challenge, where participants trained quantized models to perform 3X image upscaling, using the DIV2K dataset. The proposed solutions achieved real-time performance on mobile or edge NPUs and are compatible with major mobile AI accelerators. The proposed solutions can reconstruct Full HD images under 40-60 ms while providing high fidelity results. The authors provided a detailed description of all the models developed in the challenge.
