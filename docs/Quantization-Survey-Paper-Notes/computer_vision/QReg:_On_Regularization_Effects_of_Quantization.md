# QReg: On Regularization Effects of Quantization

## Summary

<Summary: > This paper explores the effects of weight quantization as a form of regularization in deep neural network training. The authors provide an analytical study and empirical results to prove their hypothesis. They conclude that weight quantization is correlated with regularization and propose that 8-bit quantization is a reliable form of regularization in various vision tasks and models.

<Abstract: > In this paper, the effects of quantization in DNN training are studied. The authors hypothesize that weight quantization is a form of regularization, and the amount of regularization is correlated with the quantization level. They confirm their hypothesis by providing analytical study and empirical results. The magnitude of the noise caused by weight quantization is shown to be correlated with the level of quantization. An extensive list of experiments is performed, and it is demonstrated that the regularization effects of quantization can be seen in various vision tasks and models, over various datasets. The authors propose that 8-bit quantization provides a reliable form of regularization in different vision tasks and models.
