# Projection convolutional neural networks for 1-bit cnns via discrete back propagation

## Summary

<Summary: > The paper introduced Projection Convolutional Neural Networks (PCNNs) with a discrete backpropagation via projection (DBPP) method to optimize the performance of binarized neural networks (BNNs). The authors achieved highly compressed CNNs using the projection function to efficiently solve the discrete backpropagation problem. The authors also developed a set of diverse quantized kernels that improved compression of full-precision kernels. The PCNNs showed better classification performance compared to other state-of-the-art BNNs on the ImageNet and CIFAR datasets.

<Abstract:> In this paper, the Projection Convolutional Neural Networks (PCNNs) with a discrete back propagation via projection (DBPP) method is introduced to improve the performance of binarized neural networks (BNNs). The contributions of the paper include exploiting the projection function to efficiently solve the discrete back propagation problem leading to a new highly compressed CNNs (termed PCNNs) for the first time; learning a set of diverse quantized kernels that compress the full-precision kernels in a more efficient way than those proposed previously by exploiting multiple projections; and achieving the best classification performance compared to other state-of-the-art BNNs on the ImageNet and CIFAR datasets.
