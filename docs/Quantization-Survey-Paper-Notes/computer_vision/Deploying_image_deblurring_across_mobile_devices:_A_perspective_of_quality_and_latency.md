# Deploying image deblurring across mobile devices: A perspective of quality and latency

## Summary

<Summary: > The paper focuses on the challenge of deploying image deblurring on mobile devices with acceptable latency. The authors searched for portable network architectures for better quality-latency trade-off and used quantization and pruning for image deblurring. They conducted comprehensive experiments and comparisons and successfully deployed image deblurring application on mobile devices with the acceleration of deep learning accelerators. The paper provides practical deployment guidelines and has been adopted by the championship-winning team in NTIRE 2020 Image Deblurring Challenge on Smartphone Track.

<Abstract: > In this paper, we focus on the challenge of deploying image deblurring on mobile devices with acceptable latency. We searched for portable network architectures that provide a better quality-latency trade-off across mobile devices. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of network optimizations such as quantization and pruning for image deblurring tasks. We conducted comprehensive experiments and comparisons to analyze latency and image quality, and successfully deployed image deblurring application on mobile devices with the acceleration of deep learning accelerators. This paper provides practical deployment guidelines and has been adopted by the championship-winning team in NTIRE 2020 Image Deblurring Challenge on Smartphone Track.
