# Adversarial attack on deep product quantization network for image retrieval

## Summary

<Summary: >This paper proposes PQ-AG, a method to generate imperceptible adversarial perturbations for query images to form adversarial queries to investigate the vulnerability of Deep product quantization network (DPQN) to adversarial examples. The method successfully creates adversarial examples to mislead targeted product quantization retrieval models, degrading retrieval performance in both white-box and black-box settings.

<Abstract: >Deep product quantization network (DPQN) has received attention in fast image retrieval tasks due to its efficiency of encoding high-dimensional visual features. However, recent studies show that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples. Little effort has been devoted to investigating how adversarial examples affect DPQN. This paper proposes product quantization adversarial generation (PQ-AG), a method to generate imperceptible adversarial perturbations for query images to form adversarial queries. PQ-AG successfully creates adversarial examples to mislead targeted product quantization retrieval models, degrading retrieval performance in both white-box and black-box settings.
