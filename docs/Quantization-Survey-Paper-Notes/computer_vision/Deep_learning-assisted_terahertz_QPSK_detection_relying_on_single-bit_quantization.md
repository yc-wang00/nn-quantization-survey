# Deep learning-assisted terahertz QPSK detection relying on single-bit quantization

## Summary

Summary: The paper proposes a deep learning-assisted THz receiver using single-bit quantization which compensates for imperfections in THz devices such as in-phase/quadrature-phase imbalance, phase noise and nonlinearity. The authors derive the deflection ratio of the maximum-likelihood detector and propose a twin-phase training strategy and a neural network-based demodulator to compensate for phase offset before sampling. Simulation results show that the proposed receiver achieves satisfactory bit error rate performance.

<Abstract:>
In this paper, the authors propose a deep learning-assisted THz receiver that relies on single-bit quantization. The ultra-wide bandwidth of THz communications requires high-speed, high-resolution analog-to-digital converters, which are hard to implement due to their high complexity and power consumption. The authors investigate the imperfections of THz devices, including their in-phase/quadrature-phase imbalance, phase noise and nonlinearity. They derive the deflection ratio of the maximum-likelihood detector used by their single-bit-quantization THz receiver, which reveals the effect of phase offset on the demodulation performance, guiding the architecture design of the proposed receiver. A twin-phase training strategy and a neural network-based demodulator are proposed, where the phase offset of the received signal is compensated before sampling. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed deep learning-assisted receiver is capable of achieving a satisfactory bit error rate performance, despite the grave distortions encountered.
