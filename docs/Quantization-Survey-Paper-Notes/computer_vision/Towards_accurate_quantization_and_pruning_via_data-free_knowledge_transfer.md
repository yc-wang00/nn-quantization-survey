# Towards accurate quantization and pruning via data-free knowledge transfer

## Summary

<Summary: > The paper discusses the challenges of obtaining compact networks without access to training data and proposes data-free quantization and pruning methods by transferring knowledge from trained large networks, which leads to competitive and accurate compact networks. The proposed method facilitates the creation of more compact and lightweight networks without sacrificing performance.


## Target Task

computer vision

## Content

<Abstract: >When large scale training data is available, one can obtain compact and accurate networks to be deployed in resource-constrained environments effectively through quantization and pruning. However, training data are often protected due to privacy concerns and it is challenging to obtain compact networks without data. We study data-free quantization and pruning by transferring knowledge from trained large networks to compact networks. Our data-free compact networks achieve competitive accuracy to networks trained and fine-tuned with training data. Our quantized and pruned networks achieve good performance while being more compact and lightweight.
