# On learning semantic representations for million-scale free-hand sketches

## Summary

<Summary: > The paper proposes a dual-branch CNN-RNN network architecture for learning semantic representations for million-scale free-hand sketches. The proposed architecture is used for hashing retrieval and zero-shot recognition on million-scale sketches, and the authors conduct experiments on millions of sketches and outperform the state-of-the-art results.

<Abstract: > In this paper, the authors propose a dual-branch CNN-RNN network architecture to learn semantic representations for million-scale free-hand sketches. They explore two practical settings, hashing retrieval and zero-shot recognition on million-scale sketches using this architecture. They propose a deep hashing model for sketch retrieval and a deep embedding model for sketch zero-shot recognition. The authors conducted experiments on millions of sketches using their proposed models and outperformed the state-of-the-art results.
