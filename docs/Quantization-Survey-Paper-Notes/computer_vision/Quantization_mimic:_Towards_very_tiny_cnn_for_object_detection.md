# Quantization mimic: Towards very tiny cnn for object detection

## Summary

<Summary: The paper proposes a novel framework for training small CNNs for object detection called Quantization Mimic, which utilizes two types of acceleration methods: mimic and quantization. The approach outperforms existing methods on limited computing resources. It is the first one focusing on very tiny networks.>

<Abstract: In this paper, we propose a simple and general framework for training very tiny CNNs for object detection. Our method, called Quantization Mimic, is the first one focusing on very tiny networks. We utilize two types of acceleration methods: mimic and quantization. To evaluate our approach, we carry out experiments and verify that our Quantization Mimic algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art model acceleration methods given limited computing resources.>
