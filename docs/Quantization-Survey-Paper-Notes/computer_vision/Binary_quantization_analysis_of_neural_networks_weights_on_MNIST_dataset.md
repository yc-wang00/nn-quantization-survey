# Binary quantization analysis of neural networks weights on MNIST dataset

## Summary

Summary: This paper proposes a binary scalar quantizer for Laplacian source that is implemented for compressing neural network weights. Two variance range selection criteria are suggested, and the performance is evaluated for a classification task. The experimental results show good matching between theory and practice.

<Abstract: >This paper discusses the design of a binary scalar quantizer for Laplacian source and its application in compressed neural networks. Two selection criteria for the variance range are proposed, and the binary quantizers are implemented for compressing neural network weights. The performance is analyzed for a simple classification task, and good matching between theory and experiment is observed. The paper concludes with a summary of experimental results obtained by implementation in neural networks.
