Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new method for large scale image classification that can generalize to new classes at near-zero cost. The main idea is to learn a Mahalanobis distance metric in the embedded feature space, and use it to compare test images to labeled class prototypes. Our method is designed to be efficient in terms of both memory and computation, and can handle very large numbers of classes and images. We demonstrate our approach on several large-scale datasets, and show that it outperforms existing methods while being much more scalable.
