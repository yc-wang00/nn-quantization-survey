# Product quantization for nearest neighbor search

## Summary

<Summary: >The paper presents a product quantization based method for approximate nearest neighbor search that partitions the space into low dimensional subspaces and quantizes them independently, resulting in efficient nearest neighbor search. The approach shows superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods for SIFT and GIST image descriptors and is validated on a large dataset of two billion vectors.

<Abstract: >This paper introduces a product quantization based approach for approximate nearest neighbor search. The idea is to decomposes the space into a Cartesian product of low dimensional subspaces and to quantize each subspace separately. Experimental results show that our approach searches for nearest neighbors efficiently, in particular in combination with an inverted file system. Results for SIFT and GIST image descriptors show excellent search accuracy outperforming three state-of-the-art approaches. The scalability of our approach is validated on a dataset of two billion vectors.
