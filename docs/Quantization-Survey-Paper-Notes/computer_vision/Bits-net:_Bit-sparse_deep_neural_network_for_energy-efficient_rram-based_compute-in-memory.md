# Bits-net: Bit-sparse deep neural network for energy-efficient rram-based compute-in-memory

## Summary

<Summary: >The paper proposes a novel model compression scheme BitS-Net that enables efficient implementation using bit-level sparsity for in-memory computing macros. The authors demonstrate that BitS-Net can improve the energy efficiency by up to 5x for ResNet models on the ImageNet dataset when applied to compute-in-memory with resistive RAM (RRAM) for developing energy-efficient DNN accelerators.

## Content

<Abstract: >We propose a novel model compression scheme that allows inference to be carried out using bit-level sparsity, which can be efficiently implemented using in-memory computing macros. In this paper, we introduce a method called BitS-Net to leverage the benefits of bit-sparsity when applied to compute-in-memory with resistive RAM (RRAM) to develop energy efficient DNN accelerators operating in the inference mode. We demonstrate that BitS-Net improves the energy efficiency by up to 5x for ResNet models on the ImageNet dataset.
