## Summary

<Summary: >This paper proposes a two-stage quantization method that optimizes bit-width allocation for different channels and distills knowledge from pre-trained models to achieve effective low-bit quantization without time-consuming training or access to full datasets. Experiments on image classification and object detection show promising results in 4-bit quantization.

<Abstract: >Network quantization is crucial for the deployment of complex Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on mobile equipment. However, low-bit quantization without time-consuming training or access to full datasets is still challenging. In this paper, a two-stage quantization method is proposed that only requires a few unlabeled samples. Firstly, a gradient-based approach is presented to optimize bit-width allocation for different channels according to their sensitivity. Secondly, quantization is refined by distilling knowledge from the output and intermediate features of the pre-trained model. Experiments on image classification and object detection demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving promising results in 4-bit quantization.
