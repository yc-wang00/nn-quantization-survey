# Domain-smoothing network for zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval

## Summary

Summary: The paper proposes a Domain-Smoothing Network (DSN) to address the challenges in cross-modal retrieval task of Zero-Shot Sketch-Based Image Retrieval. The approach involves using a cross-modal contrastive method and a category-specific memory bank with sketch features. The method demonstrated state-of-the-art results on Sketchy and TU-Berlin datasets.

<Abstract:>
Zero-Shot Sketch-Based Image Retrieval (ZS-SBIR) is a challenging cross-modal retrieval task. In this paper, we propose a Domain-Smoothing Network (DSN) to tackle the problem of the domain gap between sketches and natural images and the large intra-class diversity in sketches. Our approach consists of a cross-modal contrastive method and a category-specific memory bank with sketch features. The method achieved state-of-the-art results on both Sketchy and TU-Berlin datasets.
