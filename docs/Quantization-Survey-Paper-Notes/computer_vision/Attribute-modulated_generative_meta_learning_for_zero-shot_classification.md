# Attribute-modulated generative meta learning for zero-shot classification

## Summary

<Summary: >The research proposes an Attribute-Modulated generative meta-model for Zero-shot learning (AMAZ) to adaptively modify the generator to adapt to highly diverse tasks through an attribute-aware modulation network, an attribute-augmented generative network, and an attribute-weighted classifier, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 3.8% and 3.1% in ZSL and generalized ZSL settings on four widely-used benchmarks.

<Abstract: >Zero-shot learning (ZSL) requires transferring knowledge from seen classes to unseen classes. While existing meta generative approaches pursue a common model shared across task distributions, this research proposes an Attribute-Modulated generAtive meta-model for Zero-shot learning (AMAZ). AMAZ constructs a generative network adaptive to task characteristics through an attribute-aware modulation network, an attribute-augmented generative network, and an attribute-weighted classifier. The modulation network adaptively modifies the generator to adapt to highly diverse tasks. The weighted classifier utilizes the data quality to enhance the training procedure. Experimental evaluations on four widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that AMAZ outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 3.8% and 3.1% in ZSL and generalized ZSL settings, respectively, demonstrating its superiority.
