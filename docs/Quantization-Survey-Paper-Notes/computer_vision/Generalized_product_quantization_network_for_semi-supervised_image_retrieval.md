# Generalized product quantization network for semi-supervised image retrieval

## Summary

<Summary: >The paper presents the Generalized Product Quantization (GPQ) network, which is the first quantization-based semi-supervised image retrieval scheme. The authors propose a novel metric learning strategy to maintain semantic similarity between the labeled data and use an entropy regularization term for the unlabeled data. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale real image benchmark datasets.

<Abstract: > Image retrieval methods have achieved great success with hashing or vector quantization, but expensive label information is necessary for good results. To solve this, the authors propose the first quantization-based semi-supervised image retrieval scheme: Generalized Product Quantization (GPQ) network. The authors design a novel metric learning strategy to preserve semantic similarity between labeled data and employ an entropy regularization term for unlabeled data. This increases the generalization capacity of the quantization network, leading to state-of-the-art performance on large-scale real image benchmark datasets.
