<Abstract: >Large Scale Metric Learning for Distance-Based Image Classification is the topic of this research report. The focus is on finding a way to identify images through the use of metrics that take into account the distances between points. The authors present a new metric learning method that works well for large scale datasets, and show how it can be used in a distance-based image classification system. The system is tested on several datasets and the results show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. The authors conclude by discussing the potential applications of such a method in real-world settings.
