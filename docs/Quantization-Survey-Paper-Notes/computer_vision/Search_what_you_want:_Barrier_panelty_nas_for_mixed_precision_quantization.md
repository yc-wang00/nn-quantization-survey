# Search what you want: Barrier panelty nas for mixed precision quantization

## Summary

Summary: The paper presents a new method called Barrier Penalty based NAS (BP-NAS) for mixed precision quantization that uses Barrier Penalty and Prob-1 regularizer to ensure the models are within valid domain and training is reasonable. The proposed method outperforms other mixed precision methods in terms of detection and classification in achieving higher mAP with lower bit computation cost. The proposed method is highly useful in terms of Mixed Precision Quantization, NAS, Optimization Problem with Constraint and Soft Barrier Penalty.

<Abstract:>
In this paper, the authors propose a new method called Barrier Penalty based NAS (BP-NAS) for mixed precision quantization, which can find an optimal mixed precision model that meets specific constraints on model size and computation. The proposed method uses a soft Barrier Penalty that ensures all the models searched are within the valid domain and a differentiable Prob-1 regularizer to ensure reasonable learning. The authors also employ a distribution reshaping training strategy to make training more stable. The proposed BP-NAS outperforms other mixed precision methods in terms of detection and classification, achieving higher mAP and lower bit computation cost. Keywords include Mixed Precision Quantization, NAS, Optimization Problem with Constraint, Soft Barrier Penalty.
