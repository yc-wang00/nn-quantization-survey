<Abstract: > larq is an open-source library for training binarized neural networks and other quantized neural networks. Binarized neural networks represent an extreme case of quantized networks that require special tools and optimization strategies. larq is intended to facilitate researchers in resolving research questions related to binarized neural networks and other extremely quantized neural networks. The larq API is designed to provide an easy to use, composable way to design and train binarized neural networks. The library provides tested and maintained implementations and pretrained weights for several popular extremely quantized models.
