# Deep triplet quantization

## Summary

<Summary: > This paper proposes a novel deep learning approach called Deep Triplet Quantization (DTQ) for image retrieval by introducing a triplet training strategy to deep quantization. They demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over other hashing solutions for similarity retrieval. They also design a new triplet selection approach and apply triplet quantization with weak orthogonality during training to generate compact binary codes. Experiments show that DTQ produces high-quality and compact binary codes, outperforming other methods on NUS-WIDE, CIFAR-10, and MS-COCO datasets.

<Abstract: >Deep hashing methods have achieved efficient and effective image retrieval by end-to-end learning of deep representations and hash codes from similarity data. We propose Deep Triplet Quantization (DTQ) for efficient and effective image retrieval, which introduces a novel triplet training strategy to deep quantization. The proposed solution focuses on deep learning to quantization approach that has shown superior performance over hashing solutions for similarity retrieval. We design a new triplet selection approach, Group Hard, that randomly selects hard triplets in each image group. To generate compact binary codes, we further apply a triplet quantization with weak orthogonality during triplet training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTQ can generate high-quality and compact binary codes, which yields state-of-the-art image retrieval performance on three benchmark datasets, NUS-WIDE, CIFAR-10, and MS-COCO.
