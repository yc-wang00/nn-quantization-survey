# Simultaneous similarity-based self-distillation for deep metric learning

## Summary

<Summary: > The paper proposes Simultaneous Similarity-based Self-Distillation (S2SD) as a method to improve deep metric learning (DML) for visual similarity and zero-shot applications. S2SD extends DML with knowledge distillation from auxiliary, high-dimensional embedding and feature spaces to leverage complementary context during training while retaining test-time cost and with negligible changes to the training time. Experiments and ablations across different objectives and standard benchmarks show S2SD offers notable improvements of up to 7% in Recall@1, while also setting a new state-of-the-art.
