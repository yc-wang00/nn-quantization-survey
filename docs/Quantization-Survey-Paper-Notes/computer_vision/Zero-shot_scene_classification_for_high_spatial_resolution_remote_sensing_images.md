# Zero-shot scene classification for high spatial resolution remote sensing images

## Summary

<Summary: >The paper proposes a novel approach to recognize images from unseen scene classes known as zero-shot scene classification. The proposed approach outperforms conventional approaches to remote sensing scene classification by utilizing information from high spatial resolution (HSR) image data. The experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in zero-shot scene classification. The study highlights the importance of zero-shot learning in scene classification from HSR remote sensing images.

## Content

<Abstract: >Due to the rapid technological development of various sensors, a huge volume of high spatial resolution (HSR) image data can now be acquired. How to efficiently recognize the scenes from such HSR image data has become a critical task. Conventional approaches to remote sensing scene classification only utilize information from HSR images. To overcome this drawback, we propose a novel approach for recognizing images from unseen scene classes, i.e. zero-shot scene classification. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in zero-shot scene classification. Index Terms â€”Zero-shot learning, scene classification, high spatial resolution remote sensing images.
