## Content

<Abstract: >Vector Quantization (VQ) is a method for discretizing latent representations and has become a major part of the deep learning toolkit. In this work, we propose learning to dynamically select discretization tightness conditioned on inputs, based on the hypothesis that data naturally contains variations in complexity that call for different levels of representational coarseness. We show that dynamically varying tightness in communication bottlenecks can improve model performance on visual reasoning and reinforcement learning tasks.
