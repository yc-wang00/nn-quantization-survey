<Abstract: > Efﬁcient deep learning computing requires algorithm and hardware co-design to enable specialization. We propose design automation techniques for efﬁcient neural networks, including auto design specialized models, auto channel pruning, and auto mixed-precision quantization. Our learning-based, automated design achieves superior performance and efﬁciency than rule-based human design. We also demonstrate a 200% shorter design cycle than previous work, making it affordable to design specialized neural network models for different hardware platforms.
