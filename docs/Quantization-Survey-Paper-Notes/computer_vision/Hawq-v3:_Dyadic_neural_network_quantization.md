# Hawq-v3: Dyadic neural network quantization

## Summary

Summary: The paper introduces HAWQ-V3, a mixed-precision integer-only quantization framework to improve the efficiency of neural network quantization by avoiding the hidden cost of conversion between floating point and quantized integer values.


## Target Task

computer vision

<Abstract: >
Current low-precision quantization algorithms often have the hidden cost of conversion back and forth from floating point to quantized integer values. This hidden cost limits the latency improvement realized by quantizing Neural Networks. To address this, we present HAWQ-V3, a novel mixed-precision integer-only quantization framework.
