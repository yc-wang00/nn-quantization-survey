# QGTC: accelerating quantized graph neural networks via GPU tensor core

## Summary

Summary: The paper introduces a Tensor Core framework, QGTC, that supports any-bitwidth computation for quantized graph neural networks (QGNNs) on GPUs. The framework utilizes low-bit arithmetic design based on low-bit data representation and bit-decomposed computation, along with other optimizations to improve performance. It is integrated with Pytorch for better programmability and extensibility. The experiments show that QGTC achieves better inference speed than the state-of-the-art DGL framework.

This paper proposes QGTC, a Tensor Core based computing framework that supports any-bitwidth computation for quantized graph neural networks (QGNNs) on GPUs. The framework includes a novel quantized low-bit arithmetic design based on low-bit data representation and bit-decomposed computation, along with several other system-level optimizations to improve performance. QGTC is integrated with Pytorch for better programmability and extensibility. Experiments demonstrate that QGTC achieves inference speedup compared to the state-of-the-art DGL framework.
