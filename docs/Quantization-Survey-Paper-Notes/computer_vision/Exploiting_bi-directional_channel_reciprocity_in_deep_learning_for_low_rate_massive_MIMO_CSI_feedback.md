# Exploiting bi-directional channel reciprocity in deep learning for low rate massive MIMO CSI feedback

## Summary

<Summary: > The paper proposes a learning-based CSI feedback framework for MIMO wireless systems that uses limited feedback and bi-directional reciprocal channel characteristics. The authors propose two deep learning architectures, called DualNet-MAG and DualNet-ABS, which significantly reduce the CSI feedback payload. The results of experiments demonstrate that these architectures demonstrate improved performance compared to the downlink-based architecture.

<Abstract: >Channel state information (CSI) feedback is important for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless systems to achieve their capacity gain in frequency division duplex (FDD) mode. This work proposes a learning-based CSI feedback framework based on limited feedback and bi-directional reciprocal channel characteristics. We propose two deep learning architectures, DualNet-MAG and DualNet-ABS, to significantly reduce the CSI feedback payload based on the multipath reciprocity. Experiment results demonstrate that our architectures bring an obvious improvement compared with the downlink-based architecture.
