# Intraq: Learning synthetic images with intra-class heterogeneity for zero-shot network quantization

## Summary

<Summary: >The paper introduces a new zero-shot quantization (ZSQ) method called IntraQ to address the issue where existing ZSQ methods fail to preserve intra-class heterogeneity in synthetic images, limiting performance improvement. The proposed method utilizes data synthesis to represent neural networks using low-bit integers without accessing real data.

## Content

<Abstract: >Learning to synthesize data has emerged as a promising direction in zero-shot quantization (ZSQ), which represents neural networks by low-bit integer without accessing any of the real data. In this paper, we observe an interesting phenomenon of intra-class heterogeneity in real data and show that existing methods fail to retain this property in their synthetic images, which causes a limited performance increase. To address this issue, we propose a novel zero-shot quantization method referred to as IntraQ.
