# Iterative quantization: A procrustean approach to learning binary codes for large-scale image retrieval

## Summary

Summary: The paper proposes an iterative quantization algorithm for learning binary codes for image retrieval that minimizes quantization error. The binary codes outperform other state-of-the-art methods and performance improvements can result from transformation of data with a nonlinear kernel mapping prior to PCA or CCA. The algorithm is demonstrated on the ImageNet dataset for learning binary attributes or classemes.

<Abstract:> This paper proposes a method for learning binary codes for large-scale image retrieval. The proposed method aims to find a rotation of zero-centered data to minimize the quantization error of mapping the data to the vertices of a zero-centered binary hypercube. An alternating minimization algorithm, called iterative quantization (ITQ), is proposed to achieve this. The resulting binary codes outperform several other state-of-the-art methods. The paper also suggests that performance improvements can result from transformation of data with a nonlinear kernel mapping prior to PCA or CCA. Finally, an application of ITQ to learning binary attributes or "classemes" on the ImageNet dataset is demonstrated.
