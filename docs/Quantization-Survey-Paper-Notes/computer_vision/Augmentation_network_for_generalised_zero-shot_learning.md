# Augmentation network for generalised zero-shot learning

## Summary

<Summary: > This paper proposed a novel method for Generalised Zero-Shot Learning that involves the combination of visual and semantic classification without any gating mechanisms. They used temperature calibration to balance the classification between seen and unseen classes. The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art Generalised Zero-Shot Learning results in benchmark datasets and competitive results in other datasets by tackling multi-modal and multi-domain inference. An ablation study was conducted to justify each stage of the proposed approach. Keywords include generalised zero-shot learning, multi-modal inference, multi-domain inference.

<Abstract: >Generalised zero-shot learning (GZSL) is a training process where visual and semantic samples from seen and unseen classes are used to classify visual samples from seen and unseen classes. Current approaches use a single modality classifier and gating mechanisms to balance the classification between seen and unseen classes. In this paper, we propose a novel GZSL method that tackles multi-modal and multi-domain inference by combining visual and semantic classification and automatically balancing the seen and unseen classification using temperature calibration, without requiring any gating mechanisms or external domain classifiers. Our method produces state-of-the-art GZSL results for benchmark datasets and obtains competitive results for other datasets. We provide an ablation study to justify each stage of the proposed approach. Keywords: generalised zero-shot learning, multi-modal inference, multi-domain inference.
