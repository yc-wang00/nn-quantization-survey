<Abstract: >The research paper discusses problems in large-scale image classification due to the ever-growing number of images and classes. The paper focuses on two problems namely, large-scale similarity search and zero-shot/few-shots learning. It discusses the challenges in measuring similarity between large-scale images and training supervised classification models for newly emerging classes with limited labeled samples. To address these issues, the paper proposes hashing based large-scale similarity search, cross-class transfer active learning and zero-shot learning. The hashing approach uses binary codes to preserve the similarity structure, which increases efficiency. The paper also proposes a novel Collective Matrix Factorization Hashing framework to combine multi-modality features for better retrieval performance. The paper concludes with promising results on benchmarks to validate the proposed approaches.
