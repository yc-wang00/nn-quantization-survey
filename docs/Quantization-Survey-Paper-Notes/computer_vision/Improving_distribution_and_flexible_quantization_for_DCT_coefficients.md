# Improving distribution and flexible quantization for DCT coefficients

## Summary

<Summary: >This paper discusses the use of exponential power distributions (EPD) to model discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients in image compression. It also proposes a method for predicting distributions for DCT coefficients based on already decoded coefficients in neighboring blocks, and a quantization approach using optimized continuous quantization density functions for flexible and inexpensive non-uniform quantization.

<Abstract: >While it is a common knowledge that AC coefficients of Fourier-related transforms, like DCT-II of JPEG image compression, are from Laplace distribution, there was tested more general EPD (exponential power distribution) family. There is also discussed predicting distributions (as parameters) for DCT coefficients from already decoded coefficients in the current and neighboring DCT blocks. Especially for such continuous distributions, there is also discussed quantization approach through optimized continuous quantization density function q, which allows for flexible inexpensive choice of optimized (non-uniform) quantization, with rate-distortion control.
