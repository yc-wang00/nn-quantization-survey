# Weakly supervised deep hyperspherical quantization for image retrieval

## Summary

<Summary: >This paper proposes a new method called Weakly-Supervised Deep Hyperspherical Quantization (WSDHQ) that learns deep quantization from weakly tagged images. The proposed method achieved better performance on weakly-supervised compact coding compared to existing models that heavily rely on ground-truth information.

<Abstract: >Deep quantization methods have shown high efﬁciency on large-scale image retrieval. However, current models heavily rely on ground-truth information, hindering the application of quantization in label-hungry scenarios. A more realistic demand is to learn from inexhaustible uploaded images that are associated with informal tags provided by amateur users. To this end, we propose Weakly-Supervised Deep Hyperspherical Quantization (WSDHQ), which is the ﬁrst work to learn deep quantization from weakly tagged images. Exten-sive experiments show that WSDHQ can achieve state-of-art performance on weakly-supervised compact coding.
