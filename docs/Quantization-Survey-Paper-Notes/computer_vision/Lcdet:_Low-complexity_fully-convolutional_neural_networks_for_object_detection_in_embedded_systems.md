# Lcdet: Low-complexity fully-convolutional neural networks for object detection in embedded systems

## Summary

Summary: The paper proposes a fully-convolutional neural network called LCDet for object detection that is designed to work in embedded systems. It achieves similar accuracy to state-of-the-art CNN-based face detection methods while reducing model size by 3× and memory-BW by 3−4× compared to YOLO. Evaluation was done on publicly available datasets FDDB and Widerface.

<Abstract:>
Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are the
state-of-the-art performers for the object detection task.
In this work, we propose LCDet , a fully-convolutional neural
network for generic object detection that aims to work in em-
bedded systems. Our experimental results show that the proposed
method achieves comparative accuracy comparing with state-of-
-the-art CNN-based face detection methods while reducing
the model size by 3×and memory-BW by 3−4×compar-
ing with one of the best real-time CNN-based object de-
tector YOLO [23]. We evaluate the face detection perfor-
mance on publicly available dataset FDDB and Widerface.
