# Isometric propagation network for generalized zero-shot learning

## Summary

<Summary: > 
This paper proposes a new approach called the Isometric Propagation Network (IPN) for zero-shot learning, which leverages class representations and auto-generated graphs to align the semantic space of class attributes with the visual space of images. The IPN approach regularizes the two dynamic propagation procedures to be isometric by minimizing a consistency loss between them. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on three popular ZSL benchmarks and provides superior results on two larger benchmarks.

<Abstract: > Zero-shot learning (ZSL) is the process of classifying images of an unseen class based on a few attributes describing that class, without any access to training samples. The primary challenge with ZSL is aligning the representations in the semantic space of class attributes with the visual space of images. To address this issue, we introduce the Isometric Propagation Network (IPN), which propagates class representations on an auto-generated graph within each space. This approach strengthens the relation between classes within each space and aligns the class dependency in the two spaces. We propose regularizing the two dynamic propagation procedures to be isometric in terms of the two graphsâ€™ edge weights per step by minimizing a consistency loss between them. IPN achieves state-of-the-art performance on three popular ZSL benchmarks and provides superior results on two larger benchmarks.
