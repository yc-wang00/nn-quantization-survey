## Content

<Abstract: >This paper provides a framework to hash images containing instances of unknown object classes. We attempt to generate the hash codes for images belonging to unseen classes, information of which is available only through the textual corpus. We show that the proposed solution is able to generate hash codes which can predict labels corresponding to unseen classes with appreciably good precision.
