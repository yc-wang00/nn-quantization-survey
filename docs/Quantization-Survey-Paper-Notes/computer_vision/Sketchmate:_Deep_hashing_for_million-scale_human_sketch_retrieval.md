# Sketchmate: Deep hashing for million-scale human sketch retrieval

## Summary

Summary: The paper proposes a deep hashing framework for sketch retrieval that utilizes a multi-million scale human sketch dataset. It introduces the problem of sketch hashing retrieval which requires fine-grained sketch feature learning and a compact binary code for efficient retrieval. The proposed two-branch CNN-RNN architecture explores the temporal ordering of strokes and a novel hashing loss is designed to accommodate both temporal and abstract traits of sketches. Their network offers the best retrieval and generalization performance, demonstrating the benefit of their sketch-specific design.

<Abstract: We propose a deep hashing framework for sketch retrieval that works on a multi-million scale human sketch dataset. The problem of sketch hashing retrieval is introduced, which requires fine-grained sketch feature learning and a compact binary code to be learned for efficient retrieval. A two-branch CNN-RNN architecture is adapted to explore the temporal ordering of strokes, and a novel hashing loss is specifically designed to accommodate both the temporal and abstract traits of sketches. State-of-the-art hashing models engineered for static images fail to perform well on temporal sketch data whereas our network not only offers the best retrieval performance on various code sizes but also yields the best generalization performance under a zero-shot setting and when repurposed for sketch recognition. Such performances demonstrate the benefit of our sketch-specific design.>
