# Distributed adaptive binary quantization for fast nearest neighbor search

## Summary

Summary: The paper proposes an adaptive binary quantization method for generating discriminative hash codes using prototypes associated with small binary codes, making it computationally efficient and scalable for long hash codes. They also developed a distributed framework for large-scale learning and demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods in experiments.

<Abstract: Hashing is a popular technique for fast nearest neighbor search, but prototype-based methods still suffer from ineffective coding. To address this problem, we propose an adaptive binary quantization method that learns to generate discriminative hash codes with prototypes associated with small binary codes. Our method can be scaled up for long hash codes and is computationally efficient, enjoying fast training linear to the number of training data. We further develop a distributed framework for large-scale learning. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods.>
