# [PDF][PDF] TensorFlow Enabled Deep Learning Model Optimization for enhanced Realtime Person Detection using Raspberry Pi operating at the Edge.

## Summary

Summary: The paper explores the use of TensorFlow architectures to enable real-time person detection on a Raspberry Pi. The authors analyze the effects of quantization on the performance of deep learning object detection models and show that a suitably optimized TensorFlow solution architecture reduces inference time with only slight accuracy cost implications. The authors achieve industrial standard floor limit value greater than 70% on the quantized models considered, with detection time less than 3ms. Deep Neural Network model is trained using the INRIA person detection benchmark dataset.

<Abstract: In this paper, the authors explore the use of TensorFlow architectures to enable real-time person detection on a Raspberry Pi. The effects of quantization on the performance of deep learning object detection models are analyzed, and it is shown that a suitably optimized TensorFlow-enabled solution architecture significantly reduces inference time with only slight accuracy cost implications. The authors achieve an industrial standard floor limit value of greater than 70% on the quantized models considered, with a detection time of less than 3ms. The Deep Neural Network model is trained using the INRIA Person Detection benchmark Dataset. Keywords: Person Detection, Edge Intelligence, Edge Computing, Model Optimization, Model Quantization.>
