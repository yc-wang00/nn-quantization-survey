# Self-Supervised Consistent Quantization for Fully Unsupervised Image Retrieval

## Summary

<Summary: > This paper proposes a self-supervised consistent quantization approach for deep fully unsupervised image retrieval that improves semantic structure information and codeword diversity regularization. The approach uses contrastive learning for embedding and quantized representations and fuses them for consistent regularization between instances, leading to superior results on three benchmark datasets.

<Abstract:>
The paper proposes a novel self-supervised consistent quantization approach for deep fully unsupervised image retrieval. The approach consists of part consistent quantization and global consistent quantization, which focuses on semantic structure information and codeword diversity regularization. The authors introduce contrastive learning for both embedding and quantized representations and fuse them for consistent contrastive regularization between instances. With a uniÔ¨Åed learning objective, the approach exploits richer self-supervision cues to facilitate model learning. The experiments on three benchmark datasets show the superiority of the approach over state-of-the-art methods.
