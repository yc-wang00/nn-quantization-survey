# Efficient convolutional neural network with binary quantization layer

## Summary

<Summary: >This paper proposes a novel method for segmentation that leverages CNN features to generate visually and semantically coherent image segments. Binary encoding of CNN features is used to overcome the difficulty of clustering on high-dimensional feature spaces. The binary encodings can be embedded into the CNN as an extra layer for real-time segmentation. The proposed method is the first attempt at general semantic image segmentation using CNN and outperforms state-of-the-art non-semantic methods.

<Abstract: >In this paper, the authors introduce a novel method for segmentation that can benefit from general semantics of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). They propose visually and semantically coherent image segments, using binary encoding of CNN features to overcome the difficulty of clustering on the high-dimensional CNN feature space. These binary encodings can be embedded into the CNN as an extra layer at the end of the network, resulting in real-time segmentation. The authors claim that their method is the first attempt on general semantic image segmentation using CNN as opposed to being limited to a few number of categories of images. Experiments show that their segmentation algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art non-semantic segmentation methods by large margin.
