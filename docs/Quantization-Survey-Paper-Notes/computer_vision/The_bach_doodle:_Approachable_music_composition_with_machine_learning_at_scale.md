# The bach doodle: Approachable music composition with machine learning at scale

## Summary

<Summary: >The paper describes the design and implementation of an AI-powered Google Doodle called the Bach Doodle, which allows users to create their own melody and have it harmonized in the style of Bach using a machine learning model called Coconet. The authors re-implemented Coconet using TensorFlow.js and reduced its runtime from 40s to 2s by adopting dilated depthwise separable convolutions and fusing operations. The Bach Doodle was used by many people in just three days and Coconet received more than 55 million queries. Users were able to rate their compositions and contribute them to a public dataset, which the authors are releasing with the paper, for applications like ethnomusicological studies, music education, and improving machine learning models.

<Abstract: >To make music composition more approachable, we designed the first AI-powered Google Doodle, the Bach Doodle, where users can create their own melody and have it harmonized by a machine learning model in the style of Bach. We re-implemented Coconet in TensorFlow.js to run in the browser and reduced its runtime from 40s to 2s by adopting dilated depthwise separable convolutions and fusing operations. In three days, people spent 350 years worth of time playing with the Bach Doodle, and Coconet received more than 55 million queries. Users could choose to rate their compositions and contribute them to a public dataset, which we are releasing with this paper. We hope that the community finds this dataset useful for applications ranging from ethnomusicological studies, to music education, to improving machine learning models.
