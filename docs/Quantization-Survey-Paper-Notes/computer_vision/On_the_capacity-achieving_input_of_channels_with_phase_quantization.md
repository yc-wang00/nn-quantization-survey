# On the capacity-achieving input of channels with phase quantization

## Summary

Summary: The paper studies the optimal input distributions for four different channel models with multi-bit phase quantization. They show that the capacity-achieving distribution for a complex Gaussian channel with b-bit phase-quantized output is a rotated 2b-phase shift keying (PSK) and this continues to hold under noncoherent fast fading Rician channels with b-bit phase quantization when line-of-sight (LoS) is present. Furthermore, they identify 22b-symmetry and constant amplitude as the necessary and sufficient conditions for the ergodic capacity-achieving input distribution, which a 2b-PSK satisfies.

<Abstract: >Several information-theoretic studies have identified the capacity-achieving input distributions for different fading channels with 1-bit in-phase and quadrature output quantization, but an exact characterization of the capacity-achieving input distribution for channels with multi-bit phase quantization has not been provided. In this paper, the authors consider four different channel models with multi-bit phase quantization and identify the optimal input distribution for each channel model. They prove that the capacity-achieving distribution for a complex Gaussian channel with b-bit phase-quantized output is a rotated 2b-phase shift keying (PSK). The analysis is then extended to multiple fading scenarios. They show that the optimality of rotated 2b-PSK continues to hold under noncoherent fast fading Rician channels with b-bit phase quantization when line-of-sight (LoS) is present. When channel state information (CSI) is available at the receiver, they identify 22b-symmetry and constant amplitude as the necessary and sufficient conditions for the ergodic capacity-achieving input distribution, which a 2b-PSK satisfies. Finally, an optimum power control scheme is presented which achieves ergodic capacity when CSI is also available at the transmitter. The authors aim to extend the capacity results of 1-bit I/Q quantization to multi-bit quantization, specifically multi-bit phase quantization instead of conventional I/Q quantization.
