# Hardware-Aware Quantization for Multiplierless Neural Network Controllers

## Summary

Summary: The paper discusses a hardware-aware quantization technique for multiplierless neural network controllers that considers both hardware constraints and neural network accuracy requirements during the quantization process. The method determines the optimal quantization bit-width for different network layers by minimizing quantization error under hardware constraints. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves significant reduction in memory footprint and computational complexity with minimal accuracy degradation compared to existing approaches, making it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained hardware devices such as microcontrollers and FPGAs.

<Abstract: >Hardware-aware quantization techniques for multiplierless neural network controllers are described in this paper. The proposed method considers both the hardware constraints and the neural network accuracy requirements during the quantization process. The optimal quantization bit-width for different network layers is determined by minimizing the quantization error subject to hardware constraints. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves significant reduction in memory footprint and computational complexity with minimal accuracy degradation compared to existing approaches. This makes the method suitable for deployment on resource-constrained hardware devices such as microcontrollers and FPGAs.
