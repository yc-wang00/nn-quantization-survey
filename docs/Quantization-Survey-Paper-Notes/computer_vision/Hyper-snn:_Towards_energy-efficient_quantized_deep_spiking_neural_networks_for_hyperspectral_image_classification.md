<Abstract: > Hyperspectral images provide rich spatial-spectral information, but require energy-expensive 3-D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for accurate processing. To address this, we propose the use of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) generated from iso-architecture CNNs and trained with quantization-aware gradient descent. During training and inference, analog pixel values are directly applied to the input layer of the SNN. Our reduced-latency training technique combined with high activation sparsity yield significant improvements in computational efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art accuracies with substantially less computational energy on average over three HSI datasets than existing CNN methods.
