# On-device training under 256kb memory

## Summary

Summary: The paper discusses an algorithm-system co-design framework to enable on-device training with limited memory resources, specifically 256KB, which is beneficial in protecting user privacy since data does not need to be transferred to the cloud.

<Abstract: >On-device training enables the model to adapt to new data collected from the sensors by ﬁne-tuning a pre-trained model. Users can beneﬁt from customized AI models without having to transfer the data to the cloud, protecting the privacy. However, the training memory consumption is prohibitive for IoT devices that have tiny memory resources. We propose an algorithm-system co-design framework to make on-device training possible with only 256KB of memory.
