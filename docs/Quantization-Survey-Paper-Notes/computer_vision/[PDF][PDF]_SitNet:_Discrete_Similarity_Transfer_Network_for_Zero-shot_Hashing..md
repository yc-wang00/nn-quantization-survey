# [PDF][PDF] SitNet: Discrete Similarity Transfer Network for Zero-shot Hashing.

## Summary

<Summary: >The paper proposes a new zero-shot hashing approach called Discrete Similarity Transfer Network (SitNet) that preserves the semantic similarity between images from both "seen" and new "unseen" concepts. A multi-task architecture is adopted to exploit the supervised information for seen concepts and semantic vectors, and a discrete hashing layer is integrated into the network for hashcode generation. The experiments on three benchmarks validate the superiority of SitNet over the state-of-the-art.

<Abstract: >Hashing has been widely used for fast image retrieval, but collecting supervised information for re-training hashing model infeasible. In this paper, a novel zero-shot hashing approach called Discrete Similarity Transfer Network (SitNet), is proposed to preserve the semantic similarity between images from both “seen” and new “unseen” concepts. The semantic vectors of concepts are adopted to capture the similarity structures among classes, making the model trained with seen concepts generalize well for unseen ones. A multi-task architecture is adopted to exploit the supervised information for seen concepts and the semantic vectors simultaneously, and a discrete hashing layer is integrated into the network for hashcode generating, which avoids the information loss caused by real-value relaxation in training phase. Experiments on three benchmarks validate the superiority of SitNet over the state-of-the-arts.
