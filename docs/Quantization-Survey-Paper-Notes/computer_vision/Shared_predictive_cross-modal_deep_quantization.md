# Shared predictive cross-modal deep quantization

## Summary

<Summary: > The paper presents a deep quantization approach called shared predictive deep quantization (SPDQ) to improve cross-modal similarity search. The SPDQ method learns shared subspace and private subspaces for individual modalities, representations in the shared subspace and the private subspaces by embedding them to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and a quantizer in the shared subspace to produce compact codes with the help of label alignment. Experiment results on two popular benchmarks show that SPDQ outperforms existing methods.

<Abstract: > This paper presents a solution for cross-modal similarity search in the form of a deep compact code learning approach. The proposed method, called shared predictive deep quantization (SPDQ), is a deep quantization approach that leverages deep neural networks into quantization based cross-modal similarity search. The SPDQ method simultaneously learns shared subspace across different modalities and two private subspaces for individual modalities, representations in the shared subspace and the private subspaces by embedding them to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, which allows for explicit comparison of the mean embedding of different modality distributions. A quantizer is also learned in the shared subspace to produce semantics preserving compact codes with the help of label alignment. Experiments on two popular benchmarks show that the approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
