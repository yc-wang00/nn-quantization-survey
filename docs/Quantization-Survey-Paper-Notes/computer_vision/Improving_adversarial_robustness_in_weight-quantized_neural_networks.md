# Improving adversarial robustness in weight-quantized neural networks

## Summary

<Summary: >This paper proposes a boundary-based retraining method to mitigate adversarial and quantization losses in neural networks. The method adopts a nonlinear mapping approach to defend against white-box gradient-based adversarial attacks and restores accuracy better than other baseline methods, especially after quantization.


## Target Task

computer vision

## Content

<Abstract: >Neural networks, whether full-precision or quantized, are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose a boundary-based retraining method to mitigate adversarial and quantization losses and adopt a nonlinear mapping method to defend against white-box gradient-based adversarial attacks. Our method can better restore accuracy after quantization than other baseline methods on both black-box and white-box adversarial attacks.
