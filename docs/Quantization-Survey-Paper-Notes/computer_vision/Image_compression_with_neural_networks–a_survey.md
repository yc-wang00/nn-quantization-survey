# Image compression with neural networksâ€“a survey

## Summary

<Summary: This paper provides an overview of the development of neural networks for image compression. The survey covers three categories: direct image compression by neural networks, use of neural networks to implement existing techniques, and neural network based technology that improves traditional algorithms. The paper highlights the role of neural networks in assisting with traditional technologies for image compression.>

<Abstract: >Apart from the existing technology on image compression represented by series of JPEG, MPEG and H.26x standards, new technology such as neural networks and genetic algorithms are being developed to explore the future ofimage coding. Successful applications of neural networks to vector quantization have now become well established, andother aspects of neural network involvement in this area are stepping up to play signi "cant roles in assisting with those traditional technologies. This paper presents an extensive survey on the development of neural networks for imagecompression which covers three categories: direct image compression by neural networks; neural network implementation of existing techniques, and neural network based technology which provide improvement over traditional algorithms.
