# M6-Fashion: High-Fidelity Multi-modal Image Generation and Editing

## Summary

<Summary: >The paper proposes a two-stage framework called M6-Fashion which combines style prior knowledge and multimodal control for high-fidelity image generation and editing in the fashion industry. M6-Fashion separates style codes in both spatial and semantic dimensions for better image generation and has shown superior performance on various image generation and editing tasks on a large-scale clothing dataset.

<Abstract: >The fashion industry has diverse applications in multi-modal image generation and editing. It aims to create a desired high-fidelity image with the multi-modal conditional signal as guidance. In this paper, we adapt both style prior knowledge and flexibility of multi-modal control into one unified two-stage framework, M6-Fashion, focusing on the practical AI-aided Fashion design. M6-Fashion decouples style codes in both spatial and semantic dimensions to guarantee high-fidelity image generation. Extensive experiments on a large-scale clothing dataset M2C-Fashion demonstrates superior performances on various image generation and editing tasks.
