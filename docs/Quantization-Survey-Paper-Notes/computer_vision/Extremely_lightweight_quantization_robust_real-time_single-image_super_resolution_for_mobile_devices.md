# Extremely lightweight quantization robust real-time single-image super resolution for mobile devices

## Summary

Summary: This paper proposes a lightweight quantization robust real-time super resolution network (XLSR) that is hardware limitation aware and achieves state-of-the-art results in Single-Image Super Resolution (SISR) using deep learning methodologies. The network overcomes the limitations of previous state-of-the-art methods that have millions of parameters and layers, making it more practical for real-world applications.

<Abstract: Single-Image Super Resolution (SISR) is a classical computer vision problem and it has been studied for over decades. With the recent success of deep learning methods, recent work on SISR focuses solutions with deep learning methodologies and achieves state-of-the-art results. However most of the state-of-the-art SISR methods contain millions of parameters and layers, which limits their practical applications. In this paper, we propose a hardware (Synaptics Dolphin NPU) limitation aware, extremely lightweight quantization robust real-time super resolution network ( XLSR ).>
