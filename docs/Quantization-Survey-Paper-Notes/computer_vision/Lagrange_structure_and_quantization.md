# Lagrange structure and quantization

## Summary

Summary: The paper proposes a path-integral quantization method for dynamical systems that don't follow from the action principle, using the Lagrange structure which allows for a natural BRST description and the construction of an AKSZ-type topological sigma-model.

## Content

<Abstract: >A path-integral quantization method is proposed for dynamical systems whose classical equations of motion do not necessarily follow from the action principle. The key new notion behind this quantization scheme is the Lagrange structure which is more general than the Lagrangian formalism in the same sense as Poisson geometry is more general than the symplectic one. The Lagrange structure is shown to admit a natural BRST description which is used to construct an AKSZ-type topological sigma-model.
