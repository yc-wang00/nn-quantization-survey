# Deep learning-based video coding: A review and a case study

## Summary

<Summary: > This paper reviews the recent development of using deep learning for image and video coding, and introduces various techniques for intra/inter-picture prediction, filtering, and encoding optimizations. The authors also present their prototype video codec called Deep Learning Video Coding (DLVC), which achieves higher compression efficiency than HEVC for video coding. The source code for DLVC is available for future research.

<Abstract: > The paper reviews the representative works about using deep learning for image/video coding, which has been an actively developing research area since the year of 2015. There have been several proposed techniques using deep learning to perform intra-picture prediction, inter-picture prediction, cross-channel prediction, probability distribution prediction, transform, post- or in-loop filtering, down- and up-sampling, as well as encoding optimizations. According to the newest reports, deep schemes have achieved comparable or even higher compression efficiency than the state-of-the-art traditional schemes for image coding, deep tools have demonstrated the compression capability beyond HEVC for video coding. In the hope of advocating the research of deep learning-based video coding, the authors present a case study of their developed prototype video codec, namely Deep Learning Video Coding (DLVC). DLVC is able to achieve on average 39.6% and 33.0% bits saving than HEVC, under random-access and low-delay configurations, respectively. The source code of DLVC has been released for future researches.
