# Compressing unknown images with product quantizer for efficient zero-shot classification

## Summary

Summary: This paper proposes a new method called Product Quantization Zero-Shot Learning (PQZSL) for compressing zero-shot classes to enable efficient Approximate NN (ANN) search. The method uses a combination of visual feature projection and individual property quantization using Product Quantization (PQ) to create a more discriminative classification for Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL). PQZSL achieves state-of-the-art performance and accelerates ANN search by 10-100 times faster than traditional NN search.

<Abstract:>
For Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL), a new method called Product Quantization Zero-Shot Learning (PQZSL) is proposed to compress zero-shot classes for efficient Approximate NN (ANN) search. Visual features are projected into an orthogonal semantic space, and then the Product Quantization (PQ) is utilized to quantize individual properties. As classes in orthogonal common space are more discriminative, the classification based on PQZSL achieves state-of-the-art performance in Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) task. The speed of ANN search is 10-100 times higher than traditional NN search.
