# 3DQ: Compact quantized neural networks for volumetric whole brain segmentation

## Summary

<Summary: > The paper proposes 3DQ, a ternary quantization method for 3D Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (F-CNNs), which significantly compresses the model by up to 16x while maintaining comparable accuracy with full precision models, especially for whole brain segmentation. The method is applicable to common 3D architectures such as 3D U-Net and V-Net and can effectively reduce the storage requirements of space-critical applications.

<Abstract: > Model architectures have been dramatically increasing in
size, improving performance at the cost of resource requirements. In this
paper we propose 3DQ, a ternary quantization method, applied for the
first time to 3D Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (F-CNNs), enabling 16x model compression while maintaining performance on par
with full precision models. We extensively evaluate 3DQ on two datasets
for the challenging task of whole brain segmentation. Additionally, we
showcase our method's ability to generalize on two common 3D architectures, namely 3D U-Net and V-Net. Outperforming a variety of baselines, the proposed method is capable of compressing large 3D models to a few MBytes, alleviating the storage needs in space-critical applications.
