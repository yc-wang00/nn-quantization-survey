# SPIQ: Data-Free Per-Channel Static Input Quantization

## Summary

<Summary: > The paper proposes a per-channel input quantization scheme named SPIQ that allows for preserving cross-channel dynamics in static input quantization, leading to accuracy levels of dynamic methods. SPIQ achieves accuracies rivaling dynamic approaches with static-level inference speed and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art quantization methods on multiple computer vision problems.

## Content

<Abstract: > Computationally expensive neural networks are ubiquitous and solutions for efficient inference have drawn a growing attention in the machine learning community. In this work, we propose a per-channel input quantization scheme that allows for more finely preserving cross-channel dynamics in static input quantization, which can reach the accuracy levels of dynamic methods. We show through a thorough empirical evaluation on multiple computer vision problems that the proposed method, dubbed SPIQ, achieves accuracies rivaling dynamic approaches with static-level inference speed, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art quantization methods on every benchmark.
