# Central similarity quantization for efficient image and video retrieval

## Summary

<Summary: >The paper introduces a new global similarity metric called central similarity, which aims to improve the learning efficiency and retrieval accuracy of data-dependent hashing methods. They introduce the concept of hash centers and provide a method of constructing such centers efficiently. The proposed Central Similarity Quantization (CSQ) optimizes the central similarity between data points w.r.t. their hash centers, leading to an improvement in large-scale image and video retrieval tasks' retrieval performance.

<Abstract: >In this paper, the authors propose a new global similarity metric, called central similarity, to improve the learning efficiency and retrieval accuracy of data-dependent hashing methods. They introduce the concept of hash centers and provide an efficient method to construct well-separated hash centers. They then propose the Central Similarity Quantization (CSQ) that optimizes the central similarity between data points w.r.t. their hash centers instead of optimizing the local similarity. The proposed method is shown to achieve a noticeable boost in retrieval performance in large-scale image and video retrieval tasks.
