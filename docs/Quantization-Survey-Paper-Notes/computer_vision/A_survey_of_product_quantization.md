# A survey of product quantization

## Summary

Summary: The paper provides a review of Product Quantization (PQ) and its derivatives and surveys recent PQ-based methods. It highlights the attractive properties of PQ, including efficient compression, efficient computation, and simplicity of coding algorithms. The paper also introduces generalized representations of PQ encoding, practical large-scale systems with an inverted index structure, and hardware-based accelerations. Additionally, an executable example of Python codes for PQ is included.

<Abstract: > Product Quantization (PQ) and its derivatives are widely used for approximated nearest neighbor search in large-scale data. In this paper, the authors review the fundamental algorithm of PQ and provide executable sample codes, followed by a comprehensive survey of recent PQ-based methods. The authors highlight three attractive properties of PQ: efficient compression, efficient computation of the approximate distance, and simplicity of the data structure and coding algorithms. The paper also introduces generalized representations of PQ encoding, practical large-scale systems with an inverted index structure, hardware-based accelerations, and an executable example of Python codes for PQ. The authors formulate the approximated nearest neighbor search problem, which is finding the database item that minimizes the distance measure to the query vector. The paper assumes the Euclidean norm for the distance measurement.
