# Relative robustness of quantized neural networks against adversarial attacks

## Summary

Summary: The paper studies the robustness of quantized neural networks (NNs) against adversarial attacks. The authors compare the relative robustness of various quantized NNs to their floating-point counterparts and find that some quantization methods improve robustness while others do not. Additionally, they propose a new method for quantizing NNs that improves robustness while maintaining accuracy.
