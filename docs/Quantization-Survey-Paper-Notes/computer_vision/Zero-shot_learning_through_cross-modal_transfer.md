# Zero-shot learning through cross-modal transfer

## Summary

Summary: The paper presents a model for recognizing objects in images without any training data using unsupervised text corpora as the only knowledge about unseen visual categories. The model maps images into a semantic space of words and uses novelty detection to determine the novelty of the image. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on known classes and reasonable performance on unseen classes without requiring any manually defined semantic or visual features.

<Abstract: >This work presents a model that recognizes objects in images with no training data for the object class. The model operates on a mixture of seen and unseen classes, and uses unsupervised text corpora as the only knowledge about unseen visual categories. The model is based on two main ideas: images are mapped into a semantic space of words, and novelty detection is used to determine whether a new image is on the manifold of known categories. Two novelty detection strategies are demonstrated. This method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on known classes and reasonable performance on unseen classes, without requiring any manually defined semantic or visual features.
