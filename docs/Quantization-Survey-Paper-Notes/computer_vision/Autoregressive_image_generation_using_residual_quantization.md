# Autoregressive image generation using residual quantization

## Summary

Summary: The paper proposes a two-stage framework for autoregressive modeling of high-resolution images using vector quantization. The framework includes Residual-Quantized VAE and RQ-Transformer, which outperforms existing AR models in generating high-resolution images for different benchmarks of unconditional and conditional image generation.

<Abstract: For autoregressive (AR) modeling of high-resolution images, vector quantization (VQ) represents an image as a sequence of discrete codes. In this study, we propose the two-stage framework, which consists of Residual-Quantized VAE (RQ-VAE) and RQ-Transformer, to effectively generate high-resolution images. Our framework outperforms the existing AR models on various benchmarks of unconditional and conditional image generation.>
