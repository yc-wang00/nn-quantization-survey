# Zero-shot sketch-image hashing

## Summary

Summary: This paper proposes a zero-shot sketch-image hashing model for efficient large-scale sketch-based image retrieval. The proposed model uses an end-to-end three-network architecture with a generative hashing scheme for zero-shot retrieval, and outperforms related works on Sketchy and TU-Berlin datasets.

<Abstract:>
Recent studies show that large-scale sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) can be efficiently tackled by cross-modal binary representation learning methods, where Hamming distance matching significantly speeds up the process of similarity search. In this paper, the authors propose a zero-shot sketch-image hashing (ZSIH) model to tackle the challenge of querying sketches with unseen categories during training. An end-to-end three-network architecture is built, with a generative hashing scheme formulated to reconstruct semantic knowledge representations for zero-shot retrieval. The proposed ZSIH model is the first zero-shot hashing work suitable for SBIR and cross-modal search, and it outperforms related works on two extended datasets, Sketchy and TU-Berlin.
