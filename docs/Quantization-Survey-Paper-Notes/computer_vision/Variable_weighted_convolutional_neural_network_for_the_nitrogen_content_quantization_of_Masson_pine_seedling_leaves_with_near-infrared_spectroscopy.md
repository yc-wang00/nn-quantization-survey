# Variable weighted convolutional neural network for the nitrogen content quantization of Masson pine seedling leaves with near-infrared spectroscopy

## Summary

Summary: The paper proposes the use of spectroscopy to predict the nitrogen content of Masson pine seedling leaves. An improved 1D convolutional neural network architecture, VWCNN, is developed to obtain better prediction accuracy and robustness. VWCNN outperforms traditional shallow prediction models and other CNN-based models, achieving high R2 and low RMSE values in both training and test datasets.

<Abstract: >Spectroscopy is a powerful non-destructive quantization tool. In this paper, the technology is used to predict the nitrogen content of Masson pine seedling leaves. To establish a better prediction model, an improved 1D convolutional neural network architecture, named the variable weighted convolutional neural network (VWCNN), is proposed in this research. For 219 fresh Masson pine seedling leaves, it shows better results in the prediction accuracy and robustness compared to those derived from the traditional shallow prediction model and other CNN-based models. VWCNN achieves a 0.984 R2 and 0.038 RMSE value in the training dataset and 0.925 R2 value and 0.075 RMSE value in the test dataset.
