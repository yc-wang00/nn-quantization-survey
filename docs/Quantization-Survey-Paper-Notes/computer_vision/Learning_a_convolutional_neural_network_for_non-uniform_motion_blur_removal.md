# Learning a convolutional neural network for non-uniform motion blur removal

## Summary

Summary: The paper proposes a deep learning approach for removing non-uniform motion blur from an image, using a convolutional neural network to predict the probabilistic distribution of motion blur at the patch level, and a Markov random field model to infer a dense non-uniform motion blur field enforcing motion smoothness. The approach effectively estimates and removes complex non-uniform motion blur not well handled by previous methods.

<Abstract: In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach for estimating and removing non-uniform motion blur from a single blurry image. We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the probabilistic distribution of motion blur at the patch level and extend the candidate set of motion kernels predicted by the CNN. We then use a Markov random field model to infer a dense non-uniform motion blur field enforcing motion smoothness. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach effectively estimates and removes complex non-uniform motion blur that has not been handled well by previous methods.>
