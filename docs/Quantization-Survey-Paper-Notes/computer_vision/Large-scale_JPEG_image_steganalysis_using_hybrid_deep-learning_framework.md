# Large-scale JPEG image steganalysis using hybrid deep-learning framework

## Summary

<Summary: >The paper proposes a hybrid deep-learning framework for JPEG steganalysis which involves hand-crafted and deep neural network stages to detect steganography. The integration of quantization and truncation into deep-learning steganalyzers boosts detection performance and is insensitive to JPEG blocking artifact alterations. The learned model can be easily transferred to different attacking targets and datasets, making it suitable for practical applications.

<Abstract: > Adoption of deep learning in image steganalysis is still in its initial stage. In this paper we propose a generic hybrid deep-learning framework for JPEG steganalysis incorporating the domain knowledge behind rich steganalytic models. Our proposed framework involves two main stages. The Ô¨Årst stage is hand-crafted, corresponding to the convolution phase and the quantization & truncation phase of the rich models. The second stage is a compound deep neural network containing multiple deep subnets in which the model parameters are learned in the training procedure. We provided experimental evidences and theoretical reflections to argue that the integration of quantization and truncation into deep-learning steganalyzers do boost the detection performance by a clear margin. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our framework is insensitive to JPEG blocking artifact alterations, and the learned model can be easily transferred to a di erent attacking target and even a different dataset. These properties are of critical importance in practical applications.
