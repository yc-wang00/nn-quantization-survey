# Self-supervised product quantization for deep unsupervised image retrieval

## Summary

Summary: The paper introduces Self-supervised Product Quantization (SPQ), a deep unsupervised image retrieval method that does not rely on precise and error-free label annotations for large training datasets. SPQ uses a Cross Quantized Contrastive learning strategy to learn codewords and deep visual descriptors, leading to accurate retrieval without supervised pre-training. The experimental results show that SPQ achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Supervised deep learning-based hash and vector quantization methods for image retrieval require precise and error-free label annotations for large training datasets. To overcome this challenge, we propose Self-supervised Product Quantization (SPQ), the first deep unsupervised image retrieval method. The SPQ network is trained in a self-supervised manner and enables us to analyze image contents to achieve accurate retrieval. We use a Cross Quantized Contrastive learning strategy to learn codewords and deep visual descriptors, which enhances retrieval performance without supervised pre-training. Extensive experiments reveal that SPQ can deliver state-of-the-art results without supervised pre-training.
