# A compression pipeline for one-stage object detection model

## Summary

Summary: This paper proposes a compression pipeline for one-stage object detection networks to meet real-time requirements. The proposed pipeline compresses the model size and inference time to 10% or less of the original while maintaining mAP reduction to 2.5% or less.


## Target Task

<Abstract: >Deep neural networks have strong fitting ability on a variety of computer vision tasks, but they also require intensive computing power and large storage space, which are not always available in portable smart devices. Although a lot of studies have contributed to the compression of image classification networks, there are few model compression algorithms for object detection models. In this paper, we propose a general compression pipeline for one-stage object detection networks to meet the real-time requirements. With this pipeline, the model size and inference time are compressed to 10% or less of the original, while the mAP is only reduced by 2.5% or less.
