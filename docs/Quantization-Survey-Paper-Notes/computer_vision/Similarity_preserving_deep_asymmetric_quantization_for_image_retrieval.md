# Similarity preserving deep asymmetric quantization for image retrieval

## Summary

<Summary:>
The paper proposes a deep learning model called SPDAQ for quantization that can learn compact binary codes and quantization codebooks for all items in a database in a time-efficient manner. SPDAQ uses an image subset and label information to preserve label similarity and an efficient optimization algorithm for the learning process. The model is experimentally shown to be superior to existing models on four benchmark datasets.

<Abstract:> Quantization is widely used for large-scale multimedia retrieval due to its effectiveness in coding high-dimensional data. However, training deep quantization models on a large-scale database is highly time-consuming, and existing models often sample only a subset for training, leading to unsatisfactory performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel model called Similarity Preserving Deep Asymmetric Quantization (SPDAQ) which can learn compact binary codes and quantization codebooks for all items in the database. SPDAQ uses an image subset and the label information of all database items to map them to different but correlated distributions, preserving label similarity. An efficient optimization algorithm is proposed for the learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model on four widely-used benchmark datasets.
