# Zero-shot hashing with orthogonal projection for image retrieval

## Summary

<Summary: >This paper presents a novel hashing method that uses orthogonal projection of both image and semantic attribute to generate binary codes. This guarantees hash codes from different classes have equal Hamming distance, making the space more discriminative. The proposed method also includes a deep model and has shown competitive results compared to current approaches in large-scale image retrieval.

<Abstract: >Hashing is a well-known large-scale image retrieval technique that has been greatly improved by integrating supervised information and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to generate quality hash codes and hash functions. However, existing hashing methods have limitations in dealing with emerging images of new classes. In this paper, a novel hashing method based on orthogonal projection of both image and semantic attribute is proposed to generate binary codes that are orthogonal with each other when they belong to different classes, and same otherwise. This guarantees that hash codes from different classes have equal Hamming distance and makes the space more discriminative. The proposed method is also extended with a deep model. Experimental results show the competitiveness of the method compared to state-of-the-art approaches. <\Abstract>
