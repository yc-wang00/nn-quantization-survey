# Low-cost stochastic hybrid multiplier for quantized neural networks

## Summary

<Summary: >The article proposes a new stochastic hybrid multiplier for quantized neural networks that achieves a 7.7x energy reduction compared to binary implementation while maintaining slightly higher recognition error rates. The design also results in 4x, 9x, and 10x reduction in terms of area, power, and energy, respectively, as supported by experimental results.

## Content

<Abstract: >In this article, we propose a new stochastic multiplier with simple CMOS transistors called the stochastic hybrid multiplier for quantized neural networks. Experimental results indicate that our stochastic design achieves about 7.7x energy reduction compared to its counterpart binary implementation while maintaining slightly higher recognition error rates than the binary implementation. Our work derives at least 4x, 9x, and 10x reduction in terms of area, power, and energy, respectively.
