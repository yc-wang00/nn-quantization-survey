# Input-to-state stabilization in probability for nonlinear stochastic systems under quantization effects and communication protocols

## Summary

Summary: The paper investigates the observer-based stabilization for a class of discrete-time nonlinear stochastic networked control systems with exogenous disturbances. The signal transmission is via a shared digital network, which considers both uniform quantization effects and stochastic communication protocols to reflect network-induced constraints. The input-to-state stability probability is introduced to characterize the dynamical behaviors of closed-loop stochastic NCS, establishing a theoretical framework to analyze the dynamics of the closed-loop system. The conditions for an observer-based controller with explicit expression of gain matrices are established, and the effectiveness is demonstrated through numerical simulation examples.

<Abstract: >In this paper, the observer-based stabilization
problem is investigated for a class of discrete-time nonlinear
stochastic networked control systems (NCSs) with exogenousdisturbances. The signal transmission from the sensors to theobserver is implemented via a shared digital network, in whichboth uniform quantization effect and stochastic communicationprotocol (SCP) are taken into account to reﬂect several network-induced constraints. The notion of input-to-state stability inprobability is introduced to describe the dynamical behaviorsof the closed-loop stochastic NCS that is effectively character-ized by a general nonlinear stochastic difference equation withMarkovian jumping parameters. A theoretical framework is ﬁrstestablished to felicitate the dynamics analysis of the closed-loopsystem in virtue of the switched Lyapunov function method andthe stochastic analysis techniques. By making full use of the quan-tized measurement output under the scheduling of the SCP, theexistence conditions for an observer-based controller are estab-lished under which the closed-loop system is input-to-state stablein probability. Then, the explicit expression of the gain matricesof the desired controller is given by resorting to a set of feasi-ble solutions of certain matrix inequalities. The effectiveness of
the theoretical results is demonstrated by a numerical simulation
example.
