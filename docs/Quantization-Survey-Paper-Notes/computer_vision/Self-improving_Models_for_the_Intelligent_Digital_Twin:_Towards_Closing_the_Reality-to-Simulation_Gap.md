# Self-improving Models for the Intelligent Digital Twin: Towards Closing the Reality-to-Simulation Gap

## Summary

<Summary: >The paper proposes a novel approach using reinforcement learning to improve Digital Twin models of autonomous mobile robots for modern Cyber-Physical Manufacturing Systems (CPMS). The approach closes the simulation gap through a three-step mechanism and uses reinforcement learning to find patterns in deviations between simulated and real data to learn compensation, resulting in promising results.

<Abstract: >This paper presents a novel approach to ensure the quality of the Digital Twin models that modern Cyber-Physical Manufacturing Systems (CPMS) rely on. Based on a reinforcement learning-based methodology, autonomous mobile robots are used as an example to show how the Digital Twin automatically improves models that do not perfectly represent the physical asset, making it an intelligent Digital Twin. The presented approach closes the simulation gap through a three-step mechanism that makes the simulated data and the real data comparable and synchronizes it, applies reinforcement learning to find patterns in the deviations between the simulated and real data, and learns to compensate for them. The evaluation of this example shows promising results.
