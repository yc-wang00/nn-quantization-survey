# Autoencoder-based error correction coding for one-bit quantization

## Summary

Summary: The paper proposes a new error correction coding scheme for AWGN channels using deep learning and one-bit quantization in the receivers. The proposed method gives nearly the same performance as the perfectly trained autoencoder and is as bandwidth efficient as the integrated turbo code. Additionally, the proposed coding outperforms conventional turbo codes even for QPSK modulation.

<Abstract: This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based error correction coding scheme for AWGN channels under the constraint of one-bit quantization in the receivers. It is empirically shown that this design gives nearly the same performance as to the hypothetically perfectly trained autoencoder, and a theoretical proof is provided. The proposed coding method is as bandwidth efficient as the integrated (outer) turbo code, and our results show that the proposed coding scheme at finite block lengths outperforms conventional turbo codes even for QPSK modulation.>
