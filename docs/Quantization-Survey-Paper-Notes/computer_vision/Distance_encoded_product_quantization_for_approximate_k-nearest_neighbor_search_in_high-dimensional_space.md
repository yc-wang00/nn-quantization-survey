# Distance encoded product quantization for approximate k-nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional space

## Summary

Summary: The paper proposes a new compact code representation for approximate K-nearest neighbor search that encodes cluster index and quantized distance between a point and its cluster center in each subspace using bit-budget distribution. It also proposes two distance estimators tailored to the representation, which is evaluated on benchmarks and shown to improve search accuracy over other tested techniques.

<Abstract:> Approximate K-nearest neighbor search is a fundamental problem in computer science, for high-dimensional and large-scale data. Recently, product quantization has been proposed as a technique for encoding high-dimensional data to compact codes. In this paper, a new compact code representation that encodes both the cluster index and quantized distance between a point and its cluster center in each subspace by distributing the bit-budget is proposed. Two distance estimators tailored to the representation are also proposed. This method is evaluated on benchmarks consisting of GIST, VLAD, and CNN features and is shown to significantly improve search accuracy over other tested techniques.
