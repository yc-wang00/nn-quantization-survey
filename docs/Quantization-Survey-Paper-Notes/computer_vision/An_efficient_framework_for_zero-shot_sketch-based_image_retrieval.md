# An efficient framework for zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval

## Summary

<Summary: > The paper discusses Zero-shot Sketch-based Image Retrieval (ZS-SBIR), which is a challenging and realistic variant of SBIR since it involves multiple computer vision problems such as content-based Image Retrieval (CBIR), zero-shot learning and domain adaptation. The proposed method that includes knowledge distillation and similarity learning achieves state-of-the-art results and outperforms related works significantly.

<Abstract: >Recently, Zero-shot Sketch-based Image Retrieval (ZS-SBIR) has attracted the attention of the computer vision community due to it's real-world applications, and the more realistic and challenging setting than found in SBIR. ZS-SBIR inherits the main challenges of multiple computer vision problems including content- based Image Retrieval (CBIR), zero-shot learning and domain adaptation. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results, and outperforms the majority of related works by a large margin.
