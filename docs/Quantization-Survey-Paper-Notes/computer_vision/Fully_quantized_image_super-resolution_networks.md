# Fully quantized image super-resolution networks

## Summary

Summary: The paper proposes a Fully Quantized image Super-Resolution framework (FQSR) for improving the inference efficiency of image super-resolution using model quantization. The proposed framework achieves comparable performance with full-precision counterparts while significantly reducing the computational cost and memory consumption. The experimental results on five benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<Abstract:>
With the rising popularity of intelligent mobile devices, it is of great practical signiﬁcance to develop accurate, real-time and energy-efﬁcient image Super-Resolution (SR) inference methods. A prevailing method for improving the inference efﬁciency is model quantization, which allows for replacing the expensive ﬂoating-point operations with efﬁcient bitwise arithmetic. Here, we propose a Fully Quantized image Super-Resolution framework (FQSR) to jointly optimize efﬁciency and accuracy. Experimental results show that our FQSR with low-bits quantization is able to achieve on par performance compared with the full-precision counterparts on ﬁve benchmark datasets and surpass the state-of-the-art quantized SR methods with significantly reduced computational cost and memory consumption.
