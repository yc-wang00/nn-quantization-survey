# Strict deformation quantization of the state space of  with applications to the Curieâ€“Weiss model

## Summary

<Summary: >The text discusses the continuous bundle of C-algebras over a given set with fibers including N=Mk(C) N and C(Xk). It further proposes the idea of strict deformation quantization of a compact Poisson manifold, Xk.

## Content

<Abstract: >Increasing tensor powers of the kkmatricesMk(C) are known to give rise to a continuous bundle of C-algebras over I=f0g[1=N[0;1] with bers A1=N=Mk(C) N andA0=C(Xk), whereXk=S(Mk(C)), the state space of Mk(C), which is canonically a compact Poisson manifold (with stratied boundary). Our rst result is the existence of a strict deformation quantization of Xk a la Rieel, dened by perfectly natural quantization mapsQ1=N:~A0!A1=N(where ~A0is an equally natural dense Poisson subalgebra of A0).
