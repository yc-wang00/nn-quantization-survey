<Abstract:>
Deep neural networks are the state-of-the-art methods for many real-world tasks, such as computer vision, natural language processing and speech recognition. Quantization is recognized as one of the most effective approaches to satisfy the extreme memory requirements that deep neural network models demand. In this survey, we give a thorough review of different aspects of quantized neural networks. Current challenges and trends of quantized neural networks are also discussed.
