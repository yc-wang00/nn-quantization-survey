# Efficient CNN-LSTM based image captioning using neural network compression

## Summary

<Summary: > The paper presents an efficient CNN-LSTM based Image Captioning model compression pipeline that reduces the model size by 73.1%, inference time by 71.3%, and improves BLEU score by 7.7% for a dataset with VGG16 or ResNet50 as an encoder and an LSTM decoder on the flickr8k dataset.

<Abstract: >In this research paper, the authors present an efficient CNN-LSTM based Image Captioning model compression pipeline using neural network compression techniques. The pipeline is tested on a dataset with VGG16 or ResNet50 as an encoder and an LSTM decoder on the flickr8k dataset. The compression architecture reduces the model size by 73.1%, the inference time by 71.3%, and improves the BLEU score by 7.7% as compared to its uncompressed counterpart.
