# Relation-based discriminative cooperation network for zero-shot classification

## Summary

<Summary: > The paper proposes a Relation-based Discriminative Cooperation Network for Zero-Shot Classification that leverages compatibility relation and significant differences among classes through cooperative learning. The proposed method demonstrates better performance than state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used benchmarks in practical zero-shot scenarios.

<Abstract: > Relation-based Discriminative Cooperation Network for Zero-Shot Classification is proposed to tackle the task of zero-shot classification (ZSC) by fully leveraging the compatibility relation between class embeddings and the significant differences among classes via cooperative learning. Specifically, we introduce two types of relational interaction mechanisms to support constructive reasoning over the target-class and the prototype-class embeddings, respectively. Based on the discriminatively learned embeddings and the refined compatibility relation, ZSC can be conducted by searching for the closest matching class on the Semantic manifold. Extensive experiments on four widely-used benchmarks demonstrate the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, and sheds new light on practical zero-shot scenarios.
