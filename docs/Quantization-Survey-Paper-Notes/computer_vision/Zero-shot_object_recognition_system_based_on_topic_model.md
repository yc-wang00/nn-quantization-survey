# Zero-shot object recognition system based on topic model

## Summary

Summary: The paper proposes a new zero-shot learning approach for object recognition, which eliminates the need for human annotation by using a topic model and hierarchical class concept. The method utilizes a Bag-of-Words model, probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis, and signature topics representation, achieving comparable performance with state-of-the-art algorithms in four public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

In this research paper, the authors propose a novel zero-shot learning strategy based on a topic model and hierarchical class concept for object recognition where training samples are missing. The proposed method eliminates the human annotation stage and achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art algorithms in four public datasets. They utilize a Bag-of-Words (BoW) model for image features, probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) for topic modeling, and signature topics representation for both seen and unseen classes. Experimental results using four publicly available datasets have shown the effectiveness of the proposed method.
