# Style-woven Attention Network for Zero-shot Ink Wash Painting Style Transfer

## Summary

<Summary: >The paper proposes a style-woven attention network to achieve zero-shot ink wash painting style transfer, where traditional Chinese painting style - ink wash - is applied to real-world photos. The authors' model disentangles feature representations for styles and contents and captures semantic correlations through unsupervised learning and an added ink style loss. The experiments show that their method achieves state-of-the-art results.

<Abstract: >Traditional Chinese painting places more emphasis on the verve in visual effect, especially ink painting, which utilizes lines to convey expression and pays little attention to texture. While some style transfer methods have recently applied traditional Chinese painting style (such as ink wash style) to photorealistic, there are limitations to applying ink stylization to different types of real-world photos in a dataset using these style transfer methods. In this paper, the authors propose a style-woven attention network to disentangle feature representations for styles and contents and achieve zero-shot ink wash painting style transfer. Their model captures the semantic correlations of content and style through unsupervised learning and an added ink style loss. Experiments on a publicly available dataset prove that their method achieves state-of-the-art results.
