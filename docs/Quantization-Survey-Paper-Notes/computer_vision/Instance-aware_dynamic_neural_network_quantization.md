<Abstract: >Quantization is a method to reduce the memory and computational costs of deep neural networks. However, the bit-width for each layer in most existing quantization methods is static, whereas natural images have diverse content, and using a universal quantization configuration for all samples is not optimal. To address this issue, we propose to conduct the low-bit quantization for each image individually, and develop a dynamic quantization scheme for exploring their optimal bit-widths. We establish a lightweight bit-controller, which is trained jointly with the given neural network to be quantized. During inference, the quantization configuration for an arbitrary image is determined by the bit-widths generated by the controller. Experimental results show that the proposed dynamic quantization method achieves state-of-art performance in terms of accuracy and computational complexity, without changing the network architecture.
