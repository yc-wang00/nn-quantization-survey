<Abstract:> 

In this paper, the authors propose a filter-wise quantization technique for on-device machine learning at consumer devices, based on the differentiable neural architecture search (DNAS). They use a two-level network structure and a novel candidate generation algorithm to compress the network by allocating different bitwidths to different convolution filters. They validate the effectiveness of their technique with MobileNetV2 on ImageNet.
