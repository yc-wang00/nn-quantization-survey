# Scientific image restoration anywhere

## Summary

Summary: The paper explores the performance and accuracy of a scientific image restoration model called TomoGAN on edge computing devices such as Google Edge TPU and NVIDIA Jetson. The results show that these devices can provide comparable accuracy to a full-fledged CPU or GPU model with faster inference response, making them suitable for low-latency inference in scientific experimental facilities.

<Abstract: >The use of deep learning models within scientific experimental facilities frequently requires low-latency inference. Edge computing devices can be useful in this context. We explore the performance and accuracy of a scientific image restoration model on edge computing devices by evaluating the deployments of TomoGAN on the Google Edge TPU and NVIDIA Jetson. We show that these edge computing devices can deliver accuracy comparable to that of a full-fledged CPU or GPU model, at speeds that are more than adequate for use in the intended deployments. Our experiments also show that the Edge TPU models can provide 3 times faster inference response than a CPU-based model and 1.5 times faster than an edge GPU-based model.
