# Semantically tied paired cycle consistency for zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval

## Summary

<Summary: > The paper proposes a SEM-PCYC model for zero-shot SBIR, which trains two branches to map visual information to a common semantic space. The model achieves state-of-the-art results on the Sketchy and TU-Berlin datasets, without requiring highly-priced aligned sketch-image pairs.

<Abstract: >Zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) is an emerging task in computer vision, allowing to retrieve natural images relevant to sketch queries that might not been seen in the training phase. In this work, we propose a semantically aligned paired cycle-consistent generative (SEM-PCYC) model for zero-shot SBIR, where each branch maps the visual information to a common semantic space via an adversarial training. Each of these branches maintains a cycle consistency that only requires supervision at category levels, and avoids the need of highly-priced aligned sketch-image pairs. Our results demonstrate a significant boost in zero-shot SBIR performance over the state-of-the-art on the challenging Sketchy and TU-Berlin datasets.
