# Transductive zero-shot hashing via coarse-to-fine similarity mining

## Summary

<Summary: >The paper presents a transductive Zero-shot Hashing (ZSH) method that uses coarse-to-fine similarity mining to transfer knowledge from source data to target data for learning hashing models for novel/target classes without training data. The method achieves significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets.

<Abstract: >Zero-shot Hashing (ZSH) is the process of learning hashing models for novel/target classes without training data. Most existing ZSH approaches use an intermediate shared semantic representation between the seen/source classes and novel/target classes, but the hash functions learned from the source dataset are biased when applied directly to the target classes. This paper presents a method for transductive ZSH and focuses on unlabelled data for novel classes. The method uses coarse-to-fine similarity mining and transfers knowledge from source data to target data, achieving significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets.
