<Summary: >This paper presents Deep Product Quantization (DPQ), which is a supervised dictionary-free hashing method used for retrieval and classification tasks. DPQ achieves higher accuracy retrieval and classification with similar computational complexity and memory footprint as the Product Quantization method.


## Target Task

## Content

<Abstract: >Product Quantization is a leading hashing technique used in the absence of labels, which constructs look-up tables approximating the features. However, the research community has shifted towards supervised dictionary-free methods that compute Hamming distances on binary representations. This paper presents Deep Product Quantization (DPQ), a technique that learns a dictionary-based supervised representation inspired by PQ, which achieves higher accuracy retrieval and classification than the latest state-of-the-art methods. DPQ learns both soft and hard representations, and obtains state-of-the-art results on various retrieval and classification experiments while maintaining similar computational complexity and memory footprint as the PQ method.
