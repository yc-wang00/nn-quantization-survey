# Zero-shot deep hashing and neural network based error correction for face template protection

## Summary

<Summary: > The paper presents a new architecture integrating deep hashing and neural network decoder for face template protection. The proposed model can handle zero-shot, one-shot, and multi-shot enrollments. It consists of two components for mapping of face images to intermediate binary codes using deep hashing and for error correction using neural network decoder. The model achieves GAR of around 85% with 0.01% FAR with zero-shot enrollment and around 99.95% GAR with 0.01% FAR with one-shot and multi-shot enrollments.

<Abstract: > In this paper, the authors propose a novel architecture that integrates a deep hashing framework with a neural network decoder for application to face template protection. The proposed architecture can be used with zero-shot, one-shot, and multi-shot enrollments and it consists of two major components: a deep hashing component, which is used for robust mapping of face images to their corresponding intermediate binary codes, and a neural network decoder component, which corrects errors in the intermediate binary codes that are caused by differences in the enrollment and probe biometrics due to factors such as variation in pose, illumination, and other factors. The system achieves approximately 85% genuine accept rates (GAR) at 0.01% false accept rate (FAR) with zero-shot enrollment, and approximately 99.95% GAR at 0.01% FAR with one-shot and multi-shot enrollments.
