# [PDF][PDF] SINGLE-SHOT SEMANTIC MATCHER FOR UNSEEN OBJECT DETECTION.

## Summary

Summary: The paper proposes a semantic matcher CNN architecture based on GoogleNet and YOLO/DetectNet architectures to detect unseen objects. The CNN takes two images and returns detected objects in the test image that correspond to the semantic class of the request image. The authors train and test their CNN on the ILSVRC 2014 dataset with 200 seen and 90 unseen classes, achieving an mAP of 23 for seen classes and 21 for unseen classes using detection-by-request training and testing protocols.

<Abstract: >
In this paper, the authors propose a single-shot semantic matcher CNN architecture based on GoogleNet and YOLO/DetectNet architectures for the purpose of detecting unseen objects. The semantic matcher takes in two images (test and request) and returns detected objects (bounding boxes) on the test image that correspond to the semantic class represented by the request (sample) image. The authors propose the detection-by-request training and testing protocols for semantic matching algorithms and train and test their CNN on the ILSVRC 2014 dataset with 200 seen and 90 unseen classes. The real-time object detection achieved an mAP of 23 for seen classes and 21 for unseen classes.
