# Incremental few-shot learning via vector quantization in deep embedded space

## Summary

<Summary:> This paper proposes a nonparametric method in deep embedded space to solve the challenge of incremental few-shot learning, where novel tasks have very few labelled training samples. The proposed method adds more reference vectors to the model using few-shot samples in each task, and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods according to experimental results.

<Abstract: >The capability of incremental few-shot learning is a challenging problem due to catastrophic forgetting. This challenge becomes greater when novel tasks contain very few labelled training samples. In this study, we propose a nonparametric method in deep embedded space to tackle incremental few-shot learning problems. The proposed method learns new tasks sequentially by adding more reference vectors to the model using few-shot samples in each novel task. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in incremental learning.
