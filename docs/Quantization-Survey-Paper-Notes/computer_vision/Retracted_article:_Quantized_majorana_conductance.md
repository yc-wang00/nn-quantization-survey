# Retracted article: Quantized majorana conductance

## Summary

<Summary: > The paper reports the observation of conductance quantization in nanowires coupled to arrays of InSb semiconductor nanowires with epitaxial aluminum shells, which is consistent with the predicted Majorana-induced quantization. The findings provide strong evidence for Majorana zero modes in such devices and demonstrate a platform for topologically protected quantum computation.

## Content

Abstract: We report the observation of conductance quantization in nanowires coupled to arrays of InSb semiconductor nanowires with epitaxial aluminum shells. The resulting devices exhibit a series of conductance plateaus at discrete values, which are consistent with the predicted Majorana-induced quantization. Our observations provide strong evidence for Majorana zero modes in such devices and demonstrate a platform for topologically protected quantum computation.
