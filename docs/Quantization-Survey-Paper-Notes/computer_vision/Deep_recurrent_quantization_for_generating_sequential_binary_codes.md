# Deep recurrent quantization for generating sequential binary codes

## Summary

<Summary: > The paper proposes a Deep Recurrent Quantization (DRQ) architecture that generates sequential binary codes to address the issue with existing quantization methods, which require training multiple models for different code lengths. The DRQ model achieves comparable or better performance than state-of-the-art models for image retrieval and requires significantly less number of parameters and training times.

<Abstract: >Quantization has been an effective technology in ANN search, but existing methods require training several models to generate different code lengths, which incurs a considerable training time cost and reduces flexibility. To address this issue, the authors propose a Deep Recurrent Quantization ( DRQ ) architecture which can generate sequential binary codes. Experimental results show that their model achieves comparable or even better performance compared with the state-of-the-art for image retrieval and requires significantly less number of parameters and training times.
