# Learning deep parsimonious representations

## Summary

<Summary: > This paper proposes a clustering-based regularization technique that promotes parsimonious representations to facilitate generalization for deep networks and interpretability of the learned representations. The proposed approach can be optimized easily with flexibility supporting sample clustering, spatial clustering, as well as co-clustering, and is proven to be effective in various tasks such as unsupervised learning, classification, fine-grained categorization, and zero-shot learning.

<Abstract: >In this paper we aim at facilitating generalization for deep networks while supporting interpretability of the learned representations. Towards this goal, we propose a clustering-based regularization that encourages parsimonious representations. Our k-means style objective is easy to optimize and flexible, supporting various forms of clustering, such as sample clustering, spatial clustering, as well as co-clustering. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the tasks of unsupervised learning, classification, fine-grained categorization, and zero-shot learning.
