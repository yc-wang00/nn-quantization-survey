# Deep learning-based image compression with trellis coded quantization

## Summary

<Summary: >The paper proposes the use of trellis coded quantizer in a deep learning based image compression framework to achieve superior performance at low bit rates. The authors present a simple image compression model consisting of three subnetworks and optimize all components in an end-to-end manner. They experiment on two high resolution image datasets and compare TCQ and scalar quantizer based on their proposed baseline model, demonstrating the advantage of TCQ.

<Abstract: >In this paper, the authors propose to incorporate trellis coded quantizer (TCQ) into a deep learning based image compression framework. They develop a simple image compression model that consists of three subnetworks (encoder, decoder and entropy estimation), and optimize all of the components in an end-to-end manner. They experiment on two high resolution image datasets and both show that their model can achieve superior performance at low bit rates. They also show the comparisons between TCQ and scalar quantizer (SQ) based on their proposed baseline model and demonstrate the advantage of TCQ.
