# Distance-based image classification: Generalizing to new classes at near-zero cost

## Summary

Summary: The paper introduces a new distance-based image classification method called the rank distance. This technique represents images as ranked sets of distances to a set of prototypes, making it computationally cheap and easy to implement. The method outperforms more complex state-of-the-art methods on several datasets and is suitable for automatic image tagging and interactive search as it can generalize well to new classes at near-zero cost.

<Abstract: Distance-based image classification techniques have recently shown great promise, because they can be used to classify images of new classes without the need to retrain the classifier. In this paper, we introduce a new distance-based classification method, which is based on representing images as ranked sets of distances to a set of prototypes. This method, which we call the rank distance, is computationally cheap and easy to implement, making it very practical as a general-purpose image classification method. Despite its simplicity, the rank distance method outperforms more complex state-of-the-art methods on a number of standard datasets. We also show that the rank distance classifier is able to generalize well to new classes at near-zero cost, making it ideal for applications such as automatic image tagging and interactive search.>
