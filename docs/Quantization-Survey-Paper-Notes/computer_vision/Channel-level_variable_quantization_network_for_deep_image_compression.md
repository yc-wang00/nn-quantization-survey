# Channel-level variable quantization network for deep image compression

## Summary

<Summary: > This paper proposes a channel-level variable quantization network for deep image compression that dynamically allocates more bitrates for significant channels and withdraws bitrates for negligible channels. The proposed method results in superior performance and better visual reconstructions.


## Target Task

computer vision

## Content

<Abstract: >Deep image compression systems mainly contain four components: encoder, quantizer, entropy
model, and decoder. In this paper, we propose a channel-level variable quantization network to dynamically allocate more bitrates for significant channels and withdraw bitrates for negligible channels. Our method achieves superior performance and can produce much better visual reconstructions.
