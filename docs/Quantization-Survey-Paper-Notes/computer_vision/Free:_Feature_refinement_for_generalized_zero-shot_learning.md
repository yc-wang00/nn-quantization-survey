# Free: Feature refinement for generalized zero-shot learning

## Summary

Summary: The paper proposes a GZSL method called Feature Refinement for Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (FREE), which uses a feature refinement module to overcome visual-semantic domain gap and seen-unseen bias in GZSL. The proposed method employs a self-adaptive margin center loss (SAMC-loss) and a semantic cycle-consistency loss to learn class- and semantically-relevant representations for seen and unseen class samples. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves significant performance gains over existing GZSL methods across five benchmark datasets.

<Abstract: > In this research paper "FREE: Feature Refinement for Generalized Zero-Shot Learning" by Shiming Chen et al., the authors propose a simple yet effective GZSL method, termed feature refinement for generalized zero-shot learning (FREE), to tackle the problems of visual-semantic domain gap and seen-unseen bias in generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL). The proposed method employs a feature refinement (FR) module that incorporates semantic-visual mapping into a unified generative model to refine the visual features of seen and unseen class samples. They also propose a self-adaptive margin center loss (SAMC-loss) that cooperates with a semantic cycle-consistency loss to guide FR to learn class- and semantically-relevant representations. The fully refined features are extracted by concatenating the features in FR. The proposed method achieved significant performance gains over its baseline and current state-of-the-art GZSL methods in five benchmark datasets.
