<Abstract:>
In this research paper, the authors propose a new Trojan attack method called BPPATTACK that is both stealthy and efficient. By exploiting human visual system vulnerabilities, the trigger of the attack is imperceptible to human inspection. The authors propose using image quantization and dithering as the Trojan trigger, without the need for training auxiliary models. To improve the attack's precision, the authors propose a contrastive learning based approach that leverages adversarial attacks to generate negative sample pairs. Evaluation on four benchmark datasets shows that the proposed method achieves high attack success rates and effectively bypasses existing Trojan defenses and human inspection.
