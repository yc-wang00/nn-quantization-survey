# Quantization loss in convolutional decoding

## Summary

<Summary: > The paper presents a new quantization scheme and branch metric calculation method for coded symbols from the AWGN channel with BPSK or QPSK modulation. The authors use cutoff rate to determine the stepsize and the smallest number of quantization bits needed for a given bit signal-to-noise ratio (Eb/NO) loss. The paper presents a 9-level quantizer and 3-bit branch metrics for a rate 1/2 code, with an Eb/NO loss of only 0.14dB. The calculations are verified by simulations of several convolutional codes, including the new memory 14, rate 1/4 or 1/6 codes used by the big Viterbi decoders at JPL.

<Abstract: >We study the loss in quantizing coded symbols from the AWGN channel with BPSK or QPSK modulation. A new quantization scheme and branch metric calculation method are presented. For the uniformly quantized AWGN channel, cutoff rate is used to determine the stepsize and the smallest number of quantization bits needed for a given bit signal-to-noise ratio (&/NO) loss. A 9-level quantizer is presented, along with 3-bit branch metrics for a rate 1/2 code, which causes anEb/.â€™Vo loss of only 0.14 dB. These results also apply to soft-decision decoding of block codes. A tight upper bound is derived for the range of path metrics in a Viterbi decoder. The calculations are verified by simulations of several convolutional codes, including the new memory 14, rate 1/4 or 1/6 codes used by the big Viterbi decoders at JPL.
