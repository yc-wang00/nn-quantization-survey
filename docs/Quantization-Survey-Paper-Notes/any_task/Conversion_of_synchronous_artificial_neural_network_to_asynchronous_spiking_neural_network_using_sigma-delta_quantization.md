<Abstract: >Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have great potential for data analysis tasks, but their direct implementation requires high processing power, consumes a lot of energy, and suffers from scalability issues. Asynchronous processing and communication, inspired by biology, is a promising solution to reduce power consumption and allow scalability. In this work, we propose a simple and efficient method to convert an ANN to a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) which uses asynchronous spikes to communicate the quantized output activations of neurons. This method outperforms previous implementations in terms of accuracy and energy consumption. Asynchronous processing is a key feature of scalable neuromorphic platforms, which can be easily scaled up without losing performance. Our focus is to introduce a hardware-efficient and straightforward method to implement an ANN in an asynchronous way.
