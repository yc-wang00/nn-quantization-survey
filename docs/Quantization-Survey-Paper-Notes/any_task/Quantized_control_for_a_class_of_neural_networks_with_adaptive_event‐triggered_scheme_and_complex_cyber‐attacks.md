# Quantized control for a class of neural networks with adaptive event‐triggered scheme and complex cyber‐attacks

## Summary

<Summary: >The paper proposes a solution to the quantized control problem for neural networks in the presence of complex cyber-attacks, employing an adaptive event-triggered scheme and a quantization mechanism to reduce communication costs. Stability of the neural network is guaranteed using Lyapunov stability theory, and controller gain is obtained from solving linear matrix inequalities. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<Abstract: >This article focuses on the quantized control problem for neural networks with adaptive event-triggered scheme (AETS) and complex cyber-attacks. It presents a mathematical model of complex cyber-attacks which includes replay attacks, deception attacks, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The AETS and a quantization mechanism are employed to relieve the pressure under limited communication resources. By utilizing Lyapunov stability theory, the stability of neural networks is guaranteed, and the controller gain is derived by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. The proposed method is verified by a numerical example.
