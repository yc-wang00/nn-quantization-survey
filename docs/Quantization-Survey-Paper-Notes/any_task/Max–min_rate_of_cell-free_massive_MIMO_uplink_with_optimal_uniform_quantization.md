# Maxâ€“min rate of cell-free massive MIMO uplink with optimal uniform quantization

## Summary

<Summary:> This paper analyzes cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) in the uplink with optimal uniform quantization. The effect of quantization is modeled using the Bussgang decomposition. The max-min problem is studied and the original problem is decomposed into two sub-problems for receiver filter design and power allocation, respectively. Geometric programming (GP) is used to solve the power allocation problem, a generalized eigenvalue problem is solved for designing the receiver filter, and a user assignment algorithm is proposed to improve performance. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed schemes.
