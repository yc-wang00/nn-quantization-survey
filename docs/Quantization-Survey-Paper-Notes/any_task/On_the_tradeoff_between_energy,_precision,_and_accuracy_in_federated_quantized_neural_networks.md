# On the tradeoff between energy, precision, and accuracy in federated quantized neural networks

## Summary

Summary: The paper proposes a framework for deploying federated learning over wireless networks with resource-constrained devices using quantized neural networks (QNNs) to achieve a finite level of precision in both local training and uplink transmission. Energy models for local training and transmission with quantization are derived, and an energy minimization problem is formulated that optimizes the level of precision while ensuring convergence. Simulation results show that the proposed framework can reduce energy consumption by up to 53% compared to a standard FL model while balancing the tradeoff between precision, energy, and accuracy in FL over wireless networks.

<Abstract: >Deploying federated learning over wireless networks with resource-constrained devices requires balancing between accuracy, energy efficiency, and precision. In this work, quantized neural networks (QNNs) are proposed to achieve a finite level of precision in both local training and uplink transmission, with weights and activations quantized in fixed-precision format. Energy models for local training and transmission with quantization are derived, and an energy minimization problem is formulated that optimizes the level of precision while ensuring convergence. Simulation results show that the proposed framework can reduce energy consumption by up to 53% compared to a standard FL model while balancing the tradeoff between precision, energy, and accuracy in FL over wireless networks.
