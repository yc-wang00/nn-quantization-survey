# Fast quantized average consensus over static and dynamic directed graphs

## Summary

<Summary: >The paper presents an algorithm for distributed average consensus in multi-agent systems with directed communication links, using quantized values and event-driven updates. It allows each agent to reach a fixed state within one quantization level to the average of initial states and can achieve finite-time convergence in dynamic directed communication topologies, with examples to illustrate its operation, performance, and potential advantages.

<Abstract: > In this paper, the problem of distributed average consensus in multi-agent systems with directed communication links is studied. The proposed algorithm operates exclusively with quantized values and relies on event-driven updates, where each node models its initial state as two quantized fractions and transmits one fraction randomly while it keeps the other stored. The algorithm's execution, on any static and strongly connected digraph, allows each agent to reach infinite time a fixed state within one quantisation level to the average of the initial states. Additionally, the operation of the algorithm is extended to achieve finite-time convergence in the presence of a dynamic directed communication topology subject to some connectivity conditions. Finally, there are examples to illustrate the operation, performance, and potential advantages of the proposed algorithm.
