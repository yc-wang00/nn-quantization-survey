# Confounding tradeoffs for neural network quantization

## Summary

Summary: The authors analyze various neural network quantization techniques to reduce computational and memory usage in deep learning. They find that tradeoffs associated with these techniques have a greater impact on network accuracy than the quantization methods themselves. To help researchers compare methods and determine the effectiveness of quantization techniques for their hardware, the authors propose the use of "quantization cards" to report design decisions.

In this research paper, the authors discuss the tradeoffs associated with various neural network quantization techniques that are developed to decrease the computational and memory footprint of deep learning. The authors empirically analyze the impact of these confounding tradeoffs on different use cases and find that they may have a larger impact on quantized network accuracy than the actual quantization methods. To address this problem, the authors propose the use of "quantization cards" to report these design decisions, which can help researchers compare methods more effectively and determine the applicability of quantization techniques for their hardware.
