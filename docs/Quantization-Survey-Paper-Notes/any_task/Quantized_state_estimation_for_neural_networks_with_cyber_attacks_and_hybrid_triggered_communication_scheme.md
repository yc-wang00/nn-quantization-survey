# Quantized state estimation for neural networks with cyber attacks and hybrid triggered communication scheme

## Summary

<Summary: >This paper discusses the issue of quantized state estimation for neural networks with the use of a hybrid triggered communication scheme that combines event and time triggered schemes. A mathematical model including both the hybrid triggered scheme and quantization is proposed, and sufficient conditions for ensuring stability of the estimating error system through the use of linear matrix inequality techniques and Lyapunov stability theory are presented. An algorithm based on LMIs is also introduced for designing a desired state estimator.

<Abstract: >This paper presents the issue of quantized state estimation for neural networks with cyber attacks and hybrid triggered communication scheme. The hybrid triggered scheme and quantization are introduced to reduce the network transmission pressure and save network resources. The hybrid triggered scheme consists of time triggered scheme and event triggered scheme. A mathematical model for estimating the state of neural networks is constructed by taking the effect of hybrid triggered scheme and quantization into consideration. The sufficient conditions are given using linear matrix inequality (LMI) techniques and Lyapunov stability theory, which can ensure the stability of estimating error system under hybrid triggered scheme. The designing algorithm of desired state estimator is also presented in terms of LMIs.
