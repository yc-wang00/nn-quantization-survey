# High Rate Communication over One-Bit Quantized Channels via Deep Learning and LDPC Codes

## Summary

Summary: This paper presents a novel methodology to design efficient error correction codes for one-bit quantization nonlinear channels. It proposes the combination of an LDPC encoder and a trained autoencoder. The LDPC encoder reduces the input space and enables the autoencoder to learn effectively. The method performs well for high-order modulation formats and has been theoretically proven to provide approximately Gaussian distributed data to the LDPC decoder despite the non-Gaussian statistics of the received signal.

<Abstract: >This paper proposes a methodology for designing efficient error correction codes for one-bit quantization nonlinear channels by combining an LDPC encoder with a trained autoencoder. The LDPC encoder reduces the input space of the autoencoder and enables it to learn more easily. The proposed error correction code shows promising results for one-bit quantization, even with high-order modulation formats such as 16-QAM and 64-QAM, and has been theoretically proven to provide approximately Gaussian distributed data to the LDPC decoder despite the non-Gaussian statistics of the received signal. The paper also discusses the history of employing neural networks for error correction codes and the contributions of the proposed method.
