# Deep learning methods for joint optimization of beamforming and fronthaul quantization in cloud radio access networks

## Summary

<Summary: > This paper investigates a deep learning approach to optimize cooperative beamforming and quantization strategies in cloud radio access network (C-RAN) systems. A well-trained deep neural network (DNN) is used to replace the optimization module to reduce computational complexity. The proposed learning solution produces a low-dimensional representation of optimal beamforming and quantization strategies, and numerical results show advantages over iterative algorithms.

<Abstract: > Cooperative beamforming across access points (APs) and fro nthaul quantization strategies are essential for cloud radio access network (C-RAN) systems. The nonconvexity of the C-RAN optimization problems, which is stemmed from per-AP power and fronthaul c apacity constraints, requires high computational complexity for executing iterative algorit hms. To resolve this issue, we investigate a deep learning approach where the optimization module is rep laced with a well-trained deep neural network (DNN). An efÔ¨Åcient learning solution is proposed wh ich constructs a DNN to produce a low-dimensional representation of optimal beamforming an d quantization strategies. Numerical results validate the advantages of the proposed learning solution.
