# The effect of uniform quantization on parameter estimation of compound distributions

## Summary

<Summary: >This paper discusses the impact of uniform quantization on the maximum likelihood estimation of probability density function parameters for a compound distribution. The Fisher information loss is used as a measure of the loss of information due to quantization. An approximation is proposed to characterize the loss's asymptotic behavior; this reduces computational complexity and investigates selecting the quantization interval for a pre-defined loss of Fisher information. Guidelines for selecting a quantization interval with a pre-defined maximum loss of Fisher information are presented, and numerical simulations demonstrate the approximation's efficiency.
