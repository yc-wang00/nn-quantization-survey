# Reconstruction-Computation-Quantization (RCQ): A Paradigm for Low Bit Width LDPC Decoding

## Summary

<Summary: > The paper proposes the Reconstruction-Computation-Quantization (RCQ) paradigm for decoding LDPC codes with low message precision. The RCQ parameters are designed using discrete density evolution, which allows for dynamic non-uniform quantization. An extension of RCQ decoding for layered architectures is also introduced, called layer-specific RCQ. The use of layer-specific message representations helps achieve better FER performance. The paper also explores FPGA implementations of RCQ decoders, which resulted in reduced hardware usage while maintaining decoding accuracy.

<Abstract: > This paper proposes the Reconstruction-Computation-Quantization (RCQ) paradigm to decode low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. The RCQ parameters are designed by discrete density evolution. This approach facilitates dynamic non-uniform quantization to achieve good frame error rate (FER) performance with very low message precision. The paper also introduces layer-specific RCQ, an extension of RCQ decoding for layered architectures. Layer-specific RCQ uses layer-specific message representations to achieve the best possible FER performance. Finally, the paper studies field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementations of RCQ decoders, achieving more than a 10% reduction in LUTs and routed nets and more than a 6% decrease in register usage while maintaining comparable decoding performance.
