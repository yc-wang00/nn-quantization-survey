# A zero-shot learning application in deep drawing process using hyper-process model

## Summary

Summary: The paper proposes a Zero-Shot Learning based approach, known as hyper-process model (HPM), to learn the relation among multiple tasks in order to shorten the machine calibration phase in high-mix/low-volume production. This approach enables the generation of new process models for process optimization, and defines a regression problem in the domain of ZSL. The results indicate that the method can learn new tasks without any available data, thereby speeding up the calibration phase and allowing quicker integration of new products into manufacturing systems.

<Abstract: >One of the consequences of passing from mass production to mass customization paradigm in the nowadays
industrialized world is the need to increase flexibility and responsiveness of manufacturing companies. The high-mix / low-volume production forces constant accommodations of unknown product variants, which ultimately leads to high periods of machine calibration. Therefore, a Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) based approach called hyper-process model (HPM) to learn the relation among multiple tasks is used as a way to shorten the calibration phase. Ultimately, the present work has two main contributions: 1) Formulation of an industrial problem into a ZSL setting where new process models can be generated for process optimization and 2) the definition of a regression problem in the domain of ZSL. The obtained results show that is possible to learn new tasks without any available data (both labeled and unlabeled) by leveraging information about already existing tasks, allowing to speed up the calibration phase and make a quicker integration of new products into manufacturing systems.
