# Prototype-based neural network layers: incorporating vector quantization

## Summary

<Summary: >This paper proposes techniques to merge neural networks with prototype-based vector quantization methods, highlighting the similarities between the two approaches and outlining how to construct prototype-based classification layers for multilayer networks. Additionally, an alternative prototype-based approach to the classical convolution operation is also presented. The authors emphasize on establishing a theoretical framework and hope to jump-start the incorporation of prototype-based learning in neural networks.

<Abstract: >Neural networks are highly accurate in complex tasks, but they lack robustness and interpretability. On the other hand, prototype-based vector quantization methods are known for being highly robust and interpretable. In this paper, the authors propose techniques and strategies to merge both approaches, especially prototype-based learning in neural networks and vice versa. They highlight the similarities between the two approaches and outline how to construct a prototype-based classification layer for multilayer networks. Additionally, the authors provide an alternative, prototype-based, approach to the classical convolution operation. The authors focus on establishing a strong theoretical framework rather than presenting numerical results. They hope that by publishing their framework, they will jump-start the incorporation of prototype-based learning in neural networks.
